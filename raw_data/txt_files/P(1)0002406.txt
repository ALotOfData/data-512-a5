Ad Text This Monday Clinton had a public interview event where she was asked to tell
about Iraq war and Intervention in Libya during her being as a secretary of
state. After attacks in Benghazi, after her actions and lies caused a national
scandal, after officially being caught on lies she afforded herself to make a
statement "I've said Iraq was a mistake. Libya was a different kind of
calculation. And we didn't lose a single person."
More than three years passed after the accident and still Clinton didn't even
contact Benghazi victims' families. She didn't even try to ask for excuse, like
those murdered Americans don't even exist. We definitely don't need a
President who lies without a twinge of conscience. Luckily most Americans
won't trust such an obvious liar.
