Ad Text A lone sniper shot 14 people and killed 5 police officers, in Dallas late
Thursday night. It was a peaceful protest against the police shootings of Alton
Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights,
Minnesota. So he turned this peaceful protest into a scene of chaos and
carnage. The wounded include seven police officers and two civilians. The
sniper, Micah X. Johnson was a black U.S. military veteran of the Afghan war.
As he was captured, he claimed he wanted to "kill white people".
There's no evidence that he was a Black Lives Matters activist. There's no
proof that he was into the movement anyhow. It happened almost a week ago
and the police can't show anything to prove there was a link between Micah
X. Johnson and Black Lives matter. But the Main stream media are telling us
time and again that «black lives matter terrorists are killing the police officers».
The main stream Media are telling us, that the protest against police terror is
a violent anti-government riot!
