Ad Text "There's no way I would have anything without her. She's my inspiration,"
Serena said about her sister. Now Serena has 23 major singles titles. She's
about to make a new world record but she's already made history.
Serena is still the best tennis player at her 35. Serena and Venus made tennis
black. Never before the world had a chance to admire black excellence on the
tennis court.
Despite the stupid mockeries aimed at their race and appearance, the
Williams sisters are still the best, full of love and perfection! Thank you sisters!
You made all of us great!
