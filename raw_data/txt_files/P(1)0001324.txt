Ad Text I immigrated to the states when I was 5 along with my mother and two older
siblings. During elementary, middle school and high school, I fought every
obstacle that was thrown my way. When I got to high school I began to take
AP classes which led me to create a goal to continue onto higher education.
Formal education allowed me to begin a career but most importantly it
allowed me to figure out a special side of me. I am so blessed and humbled to
be first-generation, undocumented, brown, and a product of the hard work of
a single mother.
