New York City has agreed to pay the estate of Eric Garner $5.9 million to
settle a lawsuit over his death after he was placed in a chokehold by a New
York Police Department officer.
The city didn't admit fault in the settlement, the comptroller's office said in
announcing the accord Monday evening.
onathan Moore, an attorney for the family, said the city made its offer of $5.9
million Monday and the Garner family, in his office, agreed unanimously to
end the case.
"There is no amount of money that would compensate them for their loss,"
Mr. Moore said. "Eric Garner is dead. He had no reason to die on that day.
Whatever you think he was doing, he shouldn't have died."
Yeah right, money won't bring Eric back. He's gone forever, and his his family
knows that. But anyway, it's some sort of victory. It's way better than nothing.
Rest in peace, Eric Garner. No justice, no peace.
