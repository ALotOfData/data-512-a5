Ad Text Please ... STOP DISCRIMINATION AGAINST HOMOSEXUAL TEACHERS!!
After eight years on the job, Margie Winters was fired as director of religious
education at Waldron Mercy Academy outside Philadelphia not because she
just married her wife, but because some parents just found out that she's
been married for all eight years.
Unfortunately LGBT teachers have long understood that openly expressing
their identity in school can make them an easy target for discrimination. It is
the biggest mistake!
When students perceive that they're not supposed to talk about
homosexuality, they conclude that there must be something wrong about
being gay. And it's a dangerous message that can lead to bullying and
harassment.
Gay teachers need to serve as example for kids! It's very powerful both for
straight students and for LGBT students to know that they have teachers and
people they respect who are LGBT and who are good at their jobs. It's
important for all students to see that nothing to be ashamed! And it must be
illegal for employers to discriminate against employees based on their actual
or perceived sexual orientation!
