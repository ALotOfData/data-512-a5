Ad Text Because They Lack Crucial Training, These Cops Severely Beat a Blind
Autistic Teen Unconscious
During the incident, Abrams, 17, suffered two seizures after police used force
against him at the Green Line's Lexington Parkway Station.
The teen suffers from Asperger's syndrome, which causes him to strongly
dislike being touched or having people in his person space, and is considered
legally blind, wearing extremely magnified glasses.
Officers thought the non-compliance of Abrams was reason enough to justify
forcibly taking him down, which resulted in him being battered and left
unconscious.
Abrams non-compliance wasn't done out of malice, but out of not really
understanding the situation, and believing he hadn't done anything wrong.
Abrams' autism makes it extremely difficult for him to interpret the intentions
or feelings of others, according to his mother. Police released the teen to the
custody of his mother rather than take him to the juvenile detention facility.
Police are trained to think like the military in combat, which means they
prioritize their own safety and the safety of fellow officers over everything
else, including that of the citizens they allegedly "protect and serve."
