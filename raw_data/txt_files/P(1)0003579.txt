Ad Text Jess Cooke was traveling through an interior US Border Checkpoint in
Waddington, New York when she was stopped for "looking suspicious" by
the border patrol. Cooke is a law student, so she knows her rights. When she
refused to consent to search, she was told to wait for a K-9 unit to arrive
before she could leave.
Cooke didn't commit any crime, that's why she wanted to leave, but officers
had the different plans. She was thrown to the ground by the male agent and
the female agent deployed the taser. After she screamed from the pain for
several seconds, she was handcuffed, while agents illegally opened her truck
and searched it. Of course, they found nothing. She spent over an hour in
handcuffs and then about 4 hours in the US customs Station in Ogdensburg
before she could go home.
This girl's day was totally ruined because cops thought that she looked
suspicious. After they ILLEGALLY searched her vehicle, she couldn't go.
This is what real terrorism looks like!
