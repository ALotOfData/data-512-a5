Ad Text For those, who are 20th generation New Mexicans a contemporary policy of
the US seems to be quite unfair. We are indigenous people. We made the
first cattle drive, started the first ranches, we were the first ranchers, miners,
mountain men, cowboys etc. in what is now the U.S.
Everything changed when white colonists came. Europe was rejecting the
worst people so those; who were arriving at our lands were killers, rapists;
murderers, thieves and other scum. So, why are their descendants worried
about immigrants? They forgot that what goes around comes around!
