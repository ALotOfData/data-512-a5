Wedding cake is back in the news with developments in both the Oregon and
Colorado bakery cases involving discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation. In Oregon,judgment has been finalized against Sweet Cakes by
Melissa, requiring Aaron and Melissa Klein to pay a $135,000 fine for refusing
service to a same-sex couple. Meanwhile, in Colorado, Jack Phillips of
Masterpiece Cakeshop, is appealing the ruling against him for refusing to
serve a same-sex couple.
In the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges,
conservatives are eager to highlight Phillips and the Kleins as evidence that
religious freedom is under attack. In fact, they have actually invented a new
claim about how these bakers' "free speech" is under attack and how
they're thus the real victims.
There's a simple solution. Since they won't agree to the conditions for having
a license to do business with the public, they shouldn't have a license to do
business with the public! This is not a free speech issue, it is an issue of
American law! They can speak about their bigotry and ignorance, not to
practice it!
