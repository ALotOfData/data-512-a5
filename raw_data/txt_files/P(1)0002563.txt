Ad Text Miley Cyrus Wants to Marry Her Girlfriend Stella Maxwell
The 22-year-old Bangerz singer and 24-year-old Victoria's Secret model
Stella Maxwell have reportedly been dating since they met on Instagram in
April. While it's only been a few months, they're ready to take the next step.
Miley's told friends that Stella is the one. And she wants to make a huge
statement with an over-the-top wedding in the fall! She can't stop talking
about how in love she is and how she wants the whole world to know...
Miley came out as bisexual recently, not all of her relationships have been
"straight, heterosexual" ones. She also told Paper magazine how she came
out to her mom when she was 14, saying, "I remember telling her I admire
women in a different way. And she asked me what that meant. And I said, 'I
love them. I love them like I love boys."'
We hope Miley can move on from the wrecking balls and think about wedding
bells once she's ready!
