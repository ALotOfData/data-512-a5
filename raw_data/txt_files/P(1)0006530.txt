Ad Text "Querer es Poder" This phrase, which is a saying I've heard my parents say
since I was a child, has been a driving force in my journey in higher
education, and it was the inspiration for my cap. It loosely translates to Where
there's a will, there's a way or If you can dream it, you can do it. It's literal
translation is also Love Is Power. Source:
