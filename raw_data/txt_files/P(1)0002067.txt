Those who fought for Black rights were wrongfully sentenced to a maximum
of 100 years in prison for the crime they never committed. They sacrificed
their lives for our chance to have a better future. Now they feel forgotten and
think that their lives were spent in vain. Don't let them think that we forgot
about their job and deeds. Let's unite and send them our message of support
to jail. Take part in our flash mob:
