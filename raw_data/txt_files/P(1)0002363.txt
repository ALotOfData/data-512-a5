Ad Text NAACP wants removal of Confederate generals from Stone Mountain
Three days after the Confederate battle flag was ceremonially removed from
the South Carolina Statehouse grounds in Columbia, Atlanta chapter of the
NAACP officially called for the removal of Stone Mountain's iconic
Confederate Memorial carving.
According to WSB-TV in Atlanta, the organization calls for the removal of all
symbols of the Confederacy from the park, as well as any other state-owned
buildings, parks and lands.
The USA is out of balance now. We loose our history! The gays, lesbians and
trans-sexuals have more rights now then other folks. They bring pervert
culture in our houses as something normal. Today, LGBT community has
turned into the head and everyone else is the tail.
We inherit the history, we make it, and we are fated to become part of it. What
kind of inheritage next generation will get? The rainbow flag that is offensive
and a symbol of hate. Instead of delete a big part of our history, can we ban
the rainbow from public display?
