Ad Text I pray for blessings for our efforts to have change in our lives and the lives of
the people who are close to us. Most importantly, that our efforts see our
children get knowledge.
Something has to change and only we have got the keys to cause change in
our society. See, they're building prisons faster... Let's encourage these
young kids to get knowledge
