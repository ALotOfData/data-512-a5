Ad Text Those duplicitous politicians say they want to end the war in Syria though all
they do makes the situation worse and leads to more blood spilled in the
Middle East. Unfortunately, many of these hypocrites have infiltrated the
American establishment. Such people benefit from regional conflicts and war
is nothing more than business for them. It was these people who launched the
missiles that never hit no terrorists but led to civilian casualties. It is them who
keep receiving money from the same actors who sponsor ISIS and other
groups. These people want more American involvement because it means
more money for them and they don't care about the terrorists. In fact, radicals
really help them increase their bloody income. The only way to resist the
corrupt elites is to oppose military actions with no particular aim and promote
anti-terrorist agenda! Focus on what's truly important and we will end the war
in Syria sooner than you can imagine.
