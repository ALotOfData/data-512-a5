Ad Text Mass Shooting At Umpqua Community College In Oregon, 10 Reported Dead
Ten people were killed and seven were wounded Thursday in a shooting at a
small community college in Roseburg, Oregon. The shooting took place in
classrooms in Snyder Hall.
Law enforcement officials have identified Chris Harper Mercer as the man
responsible for the mass shooting.He had four weapons on him - three
handguns and one assault weapon. Also he was definitely ready to put up a
fight, because he had body armor and stash of ammunition.
One of the witnesses said that the gunman first asked about people's
religions before he began firing.
The hospital said that all victims were female between the ages of 18 and 34,
and quoted a doctor who said that an "army" of doctors and nurses had
volunteered to help.
It's the 45th shooting at a school so far this year. Obama said that America is
the only country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few
months. And he's right. People already got used to this. Isn't it time for some
gun control yet?
Some white supremacists say that the killer was mixed and he supported
BLM. This information is not confirmed and is more likely to be fake. This
dude is definitely not black. His parents are Caucasian. The fact it's been a
few hours since the shooting and they haven't say what race he is means he's
white. And honestly, word "shooting" isn't used correctly here. Can we call it
terror? Oh, wait. White male though...
