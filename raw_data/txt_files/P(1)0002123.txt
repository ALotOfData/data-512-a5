Ad Text No national outrage for an incident at pool party where a black teen was shot
to death
Today, the pool party in Georgia is even more shocking than a recent pool
party in Texas. A young man from Georgia was shot to death at a pool party
at Fayette. It was an advertised on social 200 teenager's pool party which
ended up with shootings of unknown assailant for unknown reasons. One of
the five injured, a 19-year-old black teenager Clanton passed away on the
way to hospital.
In fact, the media has not made a transparent effort to cover up the incident.
Why the pool party in Georgia is a silent story? Why the police was not aware
of a large party? Why this story has no national outrage? Is it ok when a black
teenager dies?
Unfortunately, the responding police officers were not able to prevent the
tragedy. From these facts one might conclude, police officers know the
easiest ways to arrest people, but they are irresponsible to avoid the
shootings at the average pool party.
