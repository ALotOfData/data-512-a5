Ad Text Man Dies After Police Use Pepper Spray During Arrest In Alabama
A man in Alabama collapsed and died after officers sprayed him with pepper
spray while arresting him after a chase, Tuscaloosa police said Saturday.
Police said Ware ran into nearby woods and struggled with officers when they
caught up with him. Officers sprayed him with oleoresin capsicum, more
commonly known as pepper spray, according to police. The chemical agent
debilitates a person by causing temporary blindness and irritating a person's
nose and throat.
The six officers who were involved in Ware's case will remain on duty during
an investigation, according to police. Officials said police car dash cam and
body camera footage of the incident would be released after that
investigation.
This tragedy happen accidentally, and probably the police officers didn't wish
death upon him, because they tried to give him first aid. However, the man is
dead and there is no chance to rewind and bring him back. He's gone forever,
but the cops will remain on duty and get away with this murder. Is this
acceptable?
We will know about he process of detention after the investigation is over.
Let's wait and keep our eyes open. Black Lives Matter!
