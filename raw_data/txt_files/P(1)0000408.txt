Ad Text Fortunately, some patriots in the United States don't stay away, while traitors
destroy this country. Our friends from San Diego organized a rally to support
ideas of Donald Trump. Patriots carried and waved American flags, while the
Clinton/Sanders supporters carried MEXICAN flags and attempted to confront
a very diverse group of Donald Trump supporters. That explains why the
Democrats encourage the illegal immigration. They are ready to destroy
America just to be elected.
We have to defend this nation! Let's organize rallies against the illegal
immigration around the whole country! Let's flood the United States with
American flags!
If you have a desire to organize a rally in your city, please contact us. We can
help you. Only our patriotism can save the United States of America!
