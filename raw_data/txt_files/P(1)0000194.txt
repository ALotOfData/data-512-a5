Ad Text BLACK DOLLARS MATTER
While Black activists are trying to strict American government's attention by
organizing protests, Black bank owners urge Black Americans to transfer
money into their banks.
A few days ago there were started the #MoveYourMany campaign which the
main goal is to demonstrate the value of Black lives within America. At the
request of rapper Killer Mike, over 8,000 people have transferred their money
into Black-owned banks in the last 5 days.
50 years ago Martin Luther King Jr. requested Blacks to replace their funds
from non-Black banks to Black-owned institutions which would help to
empower and advance Black community.
The best way to fight the system is to break its capitalist back which is why it
is important for Blacks to invest in ourselves!
