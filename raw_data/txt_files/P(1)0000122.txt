Ad Text SCOTUS RULES AGAINST KENTUCKY CLERK IN GAY MARRIAGE CASE
The Supreme Court on Monday evening denied a Kentucky clerk's request to
keep enforcing her "no marriage licenses" policy — an attempt to avoid
issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples — while she appeals the trial
court's preliminary ruling.
Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis will have to choose whether to issue marriage
licenses, defying her Christian conviction, or continue to refuse them, defying
a federal judge who could pummel her with fines or order that she be hauled
off to jail.
For Ms. Davis to enact her own personal policy is completely unacceptable.
She is on her fourth marriage, a sinner according to her Bible, yet she's
screaming about religious convictions. What a hypocrite!
And she doesn't even perform the ceremony, only issue a license. What her
religious convictions has to do with it?? It's not up to her to make policy, it's
her role only to enact it!
Funny how all these "Christians" are preaching and practicing all this hate,
eh?
If Jesus were around today, his response would be most likely, "What the hell
is wrong with you people!"
