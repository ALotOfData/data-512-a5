Ad Text Black church vandalized for the third time in a row on Florida's Space
Coast.Was it a hate-crime?
A predominantly Melbourne black church was vandalized for the third time in
six months. According to the Melbourne Police Department, the vandal
bought axes to chop through access points to get in. Church Bishop
Jacquelyn Gordon said that the church was in the process of development
since they moved two years ago into 125,000 foot industrial complex.
Moreover, the message "SS Charleston 2" was found on the car nearby the
Church, which raised concerns about church security. SS Charleston 2
indicates the tragedy in Charleston when nine people were shot to death by
white supremacist Dylann Roof at Emanuel AME church. Before, the church
members found the words "We see u" that were painted in the radical emblem
of the Nazi party swastika.
How many hateful people living in America today? What of these people are
getting their hatred and racism from their parents or friends? What if it is a
hate crime? Has the government created a fund to assist this church?
