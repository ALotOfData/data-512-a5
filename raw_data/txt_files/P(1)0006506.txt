We all know that black communities and Natives have always been plagued
by an array of issues that we have to deal on a daily basis. Watching
America's reaction to racism is very telling. Last year, police brutality and
racism have made it t the forefront. Hundreds of unarmed black men and
women died at the hands of police officers.
We are tired to feel neglected and ignored. We all have had enough. And now
we need to come together, be honest and get the government's attention.

We do not expect you to solve generations of inequality and oppression
overnight. We do, however, expect you to come and to address the issues
and put forward a plan to make change.
