Ad Text The recent poll has shown military representatives prefer Trump two times
more than Clinton. I wonder how Hillary can even have military supporters,
our soldiers have suffered enough from the liberal-in-chief for the last eight
years.
What's also confusing in that poll — almost every fifth polled soldier refuses to
vote at all. It's a great demonstration out troops no longer trust the President,
and Clinton would definitely not change the situation.
No need to remind you what mistakes can Hillary do if allowed running our
military forces —we don't need another Iraq and we definitely don't need
another Benghazi.
