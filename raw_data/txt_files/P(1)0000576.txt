Ad Text Is it a crime to be proud of being Black? Our women are of the most beauty
and men of the most strength. American government and media try to
suppress the idea of Blacks being equal, I'm not even talking about being
better. We are better, we are tougher and we managed to pass through the
centuries of slavery and oppression! That's why we must stay together, cause
together we are power! United we stand, divided we fall! Join us! Black Pride (
