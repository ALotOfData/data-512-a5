female?
The founder and editor-in-chief of Black Millennial and one of the organizers
of Black Lives Matter NYC Arielle Newton is 23-years-old. She is black
college-educated woman who is drawing in $160,000 student loan debt.
Today, Arielle is centered on the roots causes racism and resulting epidemic
discrimination and socioeconomic illness. In fact, in her opinion the
candidates for the next president of the United States of America are
problematic in terms of lack of transparency and accountability. For instance,
one candidate is complicit in fueling the war on drugs; another one in
corrupted criminal justice system, next one in making racial justice as the
centerpiece of the campaign as a strategy to have more black voters.
Doubtless, voting won't bring us safety and won't provide us an immediate
conduit for our social well-being. Ironically, even the first black president of
the United States of America was not able to withstand the racist opposition
and law enforcement. It means voting again for anti-black system won't save
black lives, but might jeopardize it.
