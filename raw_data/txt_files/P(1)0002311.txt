Ad Text Marine veteran was forced by homeowner associations to remove USMC
stickers from his car. Our country is run by idiots! Retired marine Frank
Larison recently received a letter by the HOA, ordering him to remove his
"marine stickers" from his Chevy car. Frank and his lawyer claim that he will
face $50 a day if he refuses to do so. If he does not play those fines, he will
be towed.
Have you ever heard of someone receiving a notification to remove Obama
stickers? LGBT stickers? Those terrorists Black Lives Matter stickers? Well,
me neither! The liberal rage comes only to those who love the Old Glory or
U.S. Armed Forces.
Our whole society is ill. Libtards are allowed to do whatever they want while
even the smallest demonstration of love and devotion to America causes an
immediate intervention from the authorities.
