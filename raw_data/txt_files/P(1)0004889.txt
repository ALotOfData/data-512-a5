Ad Text There is no appropriate age to fight for your rights and stand for your
community. No matter how young you are, you should realize what happens
and take the stance of action. If you see that everyone else's effort wasn't
enough, you should contribute, too. Just look at this girl. She understands that
the problem exists and she's trying to tell people around the country about it.
We think she is hoping for the best.
