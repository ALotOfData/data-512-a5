Ad Text +size princess(we don't know her name, her Twitter account is @_illestCee)
was body-shamed by some man on the Internet. Zendaya came across his
comments on Twitter and decided to step in.
"Stumbling across this is stupid shit, she is fine as hell head to toe. [I]
guarantee [she] doesn't know you exist my man. As for her, slay on queen,"
she tweeted and offered @_illestCee a modeling gig!
"I'm really speechless right now because becoming a plus size model has
been my number one goal," the beauty replied.
Black girl magic works! Don't try to mess with it! Especially when two black
girls unite for a good purpose! Respect people!
