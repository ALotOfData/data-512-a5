Ad Text Questions about why police shot and critically wounded a 17-year-old Somali
refugee in Salt Lake City grew Monday as civil rights groups called for
answers and several hundred protesters took the streets holdings signs that
read, "Stop killer cops." It's very insane when those who are to protect us
have turned into serial killers. The most annoying part is that they have
refused to release the footage video. They need retraining. Whatever
happened to Tasers? Whatever to rubber bullets? Whatever happened to
shooting shots in the sky as a warning? Why are police wearing body cam
and we can't see it? If they're right, let's see it.
