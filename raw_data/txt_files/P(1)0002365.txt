Ad Text Rally sparks tension, conversation
A group of St. Cloud-area residents took to the stairs in front of the Stearns
County Courthouse to protest an anti-immigration. A group of Americans were
spoken out against refugees and Sharia, the Islamic law.
"We know we have issues in our community and we know they exist, but we
don't need people coming in and mixing it up and creating more problems,"
said Jane Conrad, a field representative for the East Central Area Labor
Council.
America should wake up before it's too late. Have you forgotten the fires
burning in Europe because of very bad progressive ideas? It's always bad
idea to bring people with radical beliefs into the country. Muslims don't want to
be friends with us, they should be deported back to their 7th century
countries.
