Ad Text St. Louis police shot teenager. Teen is paralyzed.
Last Saturday the 16-year-old Brandon Claxton prompted an officer to shoot
him three times in a housing complex in Hodiamont Avenue. According to
police, they responded to a call about someone with a stolen 40-caliber pistol.
Brandon Claxton is in critical conditions.
But according to witnesses, Brandon did not point a pistol at anyone but he
was trying to run away from the officers.
Where is the video evidence of police shooting? Police Chief Sam Dotson
said that there is not a clear view on video. What if police is trying to cover up
the story? Did you know that police did not allow Brandon's mother to see
her son because he was in custody? Do you believe that police was justified
to arrest Brandon?
Cameras don't lie! We need to know the truth whether the boy posed a threat
or not!
