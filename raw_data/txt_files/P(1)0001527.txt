Ad Text All people have to understand that the police service is exactly like a secret
gay club, the reason being that no one knows what goes on inside there even
if it's evident. There's a kind of code of silence, even if you saw something or
just know something about other police officer, you keep silence about it. But
if you are in a member of a club, you can be sure that no one will ever let your
secrets out. Statistically, 46% of cops admit to witnessing misconduct by other
cops! Also, 73 % of the individuals pressuring officers to keep quiet about the
misconduct are leaders. 8% of the officers who admitted to intentionally
withholding the information about officer misconduct were upper
administrators. Cops will always lie to suit interaction or conversation. Sadly
enough,"Sworn officer of the court" is most likely to lie than the citizen he is
even accusing. So, the lie is a norm for the officers who are keeping the code
of silence, and it's a miracle if a police officer tells the truth.
