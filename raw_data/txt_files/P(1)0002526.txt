Ad Text The first male couple to be married at West Point Military Academy was
attacked on 2 August in NYC's SoHo neighborhood.
Some guy screamed anti-gay obscenities at Daniel and Larry Lennox-Choate
and then attempted sucker-punching Danny. But our guys handled the
situation and tossed him in the street, like the loser he is!
As Danny and Larry wrote in a FB post. "He left covered in his own blood with
his tail between his legs.
Damn right: Gay people are not cowards or sissies:
I think this is how most (if not all) stories of queer guys and gals being
attacked should end. I so hate it when gay are the ones who have being
killed, maimed or badly beaten.
We welcome people with an outstretched hand, when they come in peace,
and with our clenched fists, when they choose to wage war against us!
