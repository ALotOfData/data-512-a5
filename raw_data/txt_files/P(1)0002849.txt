Ad Text One of our subscribers asked us to join #HillaryClintonForPrison2016 Flash
mob.
ARE YOU READY FOR A FLASH MOB, BLACKTIVISTS?
If Hillary and her party have done so much for us, why is poverty increasing in
the black community? Why we can't see economic development? Why there
are no jobs for us? Why black unemployment rate is twice as the national
average? She wasn't for us here before the elections, remember? If these
questions are asked more often, it will be another disappointing Election Day
for Hillary Clinton.
Take part in this flash mob and show everybody that no one can manipulate
black voters.
Take a picture with a hashtag #HillaryClintonForPrison2016 => Sign the
petition and spread the truth.
