Ad Text Police Officer Robert Rialmo's attorney, Joel Brodsky, says that he will be
filing a counterclaim against the estate of Quintonio LeGrier on the grounds of
assault and emotional distress. This is how it looks like when A White Police
kills a black Civiliian, and also feels it's his right to sue the dead because
sympathizers gave him a sleepless night. If it was lawful to kill Quintonio
LeGrier because he was in abnormal state of mind according to the cops,
then we ask, how about the shooting of Bettie Jones? The story is always
rewritten and painted when it comes to dealing with race. Racial disparity and
segregation cannot be overlooked in America. There is too much level of
inhumanity. The cops still things it wasn't enough killing a mentally
disordered and an innocent woman. He still has the balls to sue even the
dead. This is what living in America is like, if you are black.
