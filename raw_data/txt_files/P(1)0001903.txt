Ad Text Unarmed Black Man On A Horse Allegedly Strangled To Death By White Cop
In Mississippi
One of the last things that Jonathan Sanders, an unarmed black man,
reportedly said before he died was, "Let me go. I can't breathe." On
Wednesday night, a white police officer in the small town of Stonewall,
Mississippi allegedly strangled Sanders, a 39-year-old black horseman, with a
flashlight before killing him in view of his family members.
Officer Kevin Herrington pulled Sanders off a horse and choked him with a
flashlight, Sander's attorney, Stewart Parrish, initially told an ABC affiliate.
Parrish later clarified that those allegations came from family members who
witnessed the death. Parrish said that Sanders experienced "some kind of
asphyxiation" during the altercation.
Sanders died on the scene and leaves behind two children.
The last words of Eric garner were "I can't breathe," the last words of
Jonathan Sanders were "I can't breathe, let me go". Biting irony, isn't it?
Since when is it illegal to train your horse in close propinquity to your house?
America was always (and it is now)a police state for black people.
