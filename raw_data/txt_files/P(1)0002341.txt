Ad Text Melissa Stockwell is an Iraqi War Veteran, she was the first female soldier to
lose a limb in the Iraq War. However, she keeps it star-spangled in spite of
m isfortune.
Melissa met both Obama and G.W.Bush. But we wish all veterans were
treated like her as all of us do know that many people who sacrificed their
health for the public good are still forgotten and ignored by our officials.
