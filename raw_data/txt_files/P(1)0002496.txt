Ad Text HOMOPHOBIA STILL RUNNING STRONG IN AMERICA.
Controversial artist Ed Freeman sparked fury among conservative patriots
after sharing his own version of the 1945 image.
The outrage was caused by artist's artwork recreating iconic Iwo Jima photo.
with a gay pride flag and half-naked men has received death threats. That's a
bit too harsh treatment for an artist, don't you think? What's this; the
American version of Je suis Charlie?
Joe Rosenthal's picture of soldiers hauling a flag pole up after declaring the
island of Iwo Jima secure during the Second World War won the Pulitzer
Prize in 1945.
Around 70.000 U.S. troops fought more than 20,000 Japanese. It wasn't a
fair fight back then, and it's not a fair fight today. But there's nothing
disrespectful in this image. Isn't the imitation is the best form of homage?
