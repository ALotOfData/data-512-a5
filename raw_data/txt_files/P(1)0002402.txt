Ad Text The former secretary of state's chain of lies continues and seems like not
going to end. This Tuesday Hillary Clinton dared to state we have no
immigration crisis and things are just fine with invader policy. "I think we've
done a really good job securing the border," she declared.
Well, that's her strategy — keep lying over and over until all her words
become true (which is never). Or maybe by "good job" she meant Obama's
Government provided Hillary's sponsors like Wall-Mart Corporation with lowpaid illegal workers?
If one day God lets this liar enter the White House as a president — that day
would be a real national tragedy.
