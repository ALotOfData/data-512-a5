Ad Text On Tuesday, the police said about the shots fired at police officers in Denver
and Aurora, Colorado. What is wrong with people? The police officers protect
people. But the gang of anarchist thugs declared war against the police. I
can't belive it's possible.
The police administer the law. Law-abidingness is an important part of
American life. Of course, history knows police mistakes, but a mistaken arrest
is very rare occurance. At the same time, don't forget that officers risk their
lives every day. Americans have to honor sacrifices of policemen. Police
officers significantly improve the quality of life for the citizens of their
communities by keeping the peace despite sometimes overwhelming odds.
America has to stand against radical activists who threaten not only officers
lives, but also our security.
