Ad Text It was a powerful moment in an America that has seen hate crimes against
Muslim Americans triple since November. In an America where the
Republican political party had a 44% very unfavorable view of Islam, despite
78% of the same Republican respondents saying they neither worked with nor
had any Muslim friends. according to a YouGov poll conducted from 6 -9
March, 2015. In an America where failed businessman and top contender for
the GOP nomination Donald Trump has publicly and unapologetically called
for widespread surveillance on mosques, mass deportations, denial of asylum
to all Muslims and has lauded a plan to shoot Muslims with bullets covered in
pigs blood.
So when Bernie Sanders acts like a human being and commits his
prospective presidency (not to mention entire career) to combatting racism,
xenophobia and Islamophobia, it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that
Muslim Americans overwhelmingly support his bid for the White House.
