Ad Text Nearly half of students don't speak English at GA elementary school
A Georgia elementary school launched a new program for upcoming school
year that will rely on students who just learned English to help teach younger
students the language.
Almost half of students are served in our program for English as a second
language, so it will take years before some students master the language.
Immigrants use every excuse why they can't learn: poverty, racism, too much
homework, the list is endless. The main question is why do American
taxpayers should pay and take responsibility to provide translators for folks
who don't make an effort to learn and speak English?
This is unfair that those kids whose parents chose to immigrate here (most
illegally) are all on welfare. They know they don't have to work, because the
government will take care of them. So, if the government continues to keep
the same standards for illegal immigrants, America will become another 3rd
world country.
