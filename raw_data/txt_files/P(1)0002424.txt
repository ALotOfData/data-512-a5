Ad Text Republican strategist Karl Rove said on "Fox News Sunday" the only way to
stop gun-related violence, like the Wednesday massacre at Emmanuel
African Methodist Church in Charleston S.C., was to repeal American
citizens' Second Amendment rights.
It's strange to hear it from the man who supported 2nd amendment earlier.
The lack of clear-cut opinion is very bad character trait. However, it doesn't
matter.
The right to bear arms is inalienable right of Americans that was given us by
the Founding Fathers. The 2nd amendment guarantees private safety of the
people. The right to keep and bear arms has been recognized as existing
prior even to the creation of a written national constitution. The govermmnet
should respect the 2nd amendment and the law in general. It's pity when
some politicians think otherwise.
People should understand that a gun is not a killing tool, it's self-defense tool.
And we will stand for our right to keep and bear arms!
