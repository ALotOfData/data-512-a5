Ad Text We know million stories about ridiculous reasons why people have been
arrested but this time is out of my mind! A man was arrested for SMOKING A
CIGARETTE OUTDOORS!
I bet the news related to 'hard to believe in' but still... Watching the video I've
only noticed people peacefully enjoying the beautiful nature on a bright sunny
day, and as soon as police show up the police ruined the camping.
I wonder what would happen; if people stood together against the police? Is it
any chance to transform police brutality into something peaceful? Guys;
please; feel free to share our opinion with us in comments below.
