Ad Text The Civil Rights Activist Mary McLeod Bethune
Mary McLeod Bethune was the civil rights activist and an educator who found
the National Council of Negro Women in 1935. Being one of the 17 children of
former slaves she was the first and the only child to go to African-American
school. She found the Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute for Negro Girls
because she believed that education was the key to racial advancement. In
addition; Bethune did a lot of work to contribute to American society. For
instance; she was the president of the Florida chapter of the National
Association of Colored Women. Moreover. in 1935 Mary Bethune became an
advisory to President Roosevelt on minority affairs and later on she started
her civil rights organization. the National Council of Negro Women.
The great educator and civil right activist Mary McLeod Bethune
demonstrated the values of education. the philosophy of love and the wise
use of power. Sadly. at least 10 years of data reveals that Congress don't pay
attention to American civil rights as Mary McLeod Bethune did 80 years ago.
