Ad Text Dash cam footage helped a man to escape 5 years in jail! Evidence from a
dashboard camera from a police car helped Marcus Jeter, 30 years to escape
the jail time after he was falsely accused of resisting arrest and the assault.

was cleared.
Do you need more proofs that cops are lying bastards who would frame
anyone to save themselves!
