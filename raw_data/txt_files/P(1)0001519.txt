Ad Text Why don't american cops realize that being black is not a crime? African
american kids are being shot only for playing with toy guns... How is it
possible? Where is the justice? Our Government is blind, they simply don't
want to pay attention to this legalized homicide of own people... This is crazy!
We must speak about it!
