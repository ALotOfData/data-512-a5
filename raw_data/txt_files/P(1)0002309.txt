Ad Text A very touching story. Roberto Gonzalez, a dying Vietnam veteran from
Texas made this special request last weekend. Hospital staff and Roberto's
family arranged his final meeting with two horses.
Gonzalez was paralyzed in Vietnam during his service. He gave his health
away in the name of America like thousands of our brave soldiers did.
Unfortunately no one can return their health and lives back. Our best people
have to live the shortest lives. If only our Government could pay more
attention to our heroes' problems to make them a bit happier and to make
their heroic lives a bit longer.
