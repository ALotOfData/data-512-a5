up on the shores of West Africa and was adopted by her rescuers. She
became the wife of a Prince and started a dynasty that extends into many of
today's Xhosa royal families. Due to her recessive gene, now and then a child
is born in the area with bright blue eyes. This is fascinating! This is a pure luck
for a Black girl to be adopted and loved after being thrown to the sea. I guess
she deserved to be a queen after what she had experienced. Black people
are the best of the best and I'm proud to be Black! #Blackprideus #black
