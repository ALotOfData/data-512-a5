Ad Text When Ebony Hilton was 8, she promised her mother that one day she will
become a doctor. Since that moment Ebony's mother called her "Dr. Hilton". It
wasn't easy to follow the dream for Ebony. Or it's better to say that there were
some hardships â€” for example, Ebony was growing without a father etc, but
despite these things she successfully got the proper education and became
the first black female anesthesiologist in 2013. Hilton says she never had plan
B.
Now she is mentoring youth as a member of program called Girls Loving
OurSelves Successfully (GLOSS).
That's sweet. Black women always show the power in any conditions. That's
inspiring! And it's especially good that Hilton dedicated herself to teaching
others.
