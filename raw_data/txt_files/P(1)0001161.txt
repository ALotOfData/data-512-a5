Ad Text This is exactly what i have been trying to tell y'all. Your vote should be
precious to y'all cus its your power to put another person in authority over
you, your freedom, your daily life and your safety.
To most people, it's about just going out to vote, if you did just that because
you want to, well done, if you didn't, aka #BOYCOTT just like me, you also
got your reasons.
BUT, let those reasons be genuine! Let them be your reasons, not influenced
upon or manipulated in any way.
I'm proud of this mama not because she didn't vote #Hillary or #Trump, but
simply because she did her research, decided for herself, in her interest and
the interest of her kids, and voted consciously!
I'm glad i choose not to be a part of this whole system.
Im proud to be woke
