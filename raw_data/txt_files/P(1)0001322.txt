Ad Text This is Juanita, daughter of immigrants. She was raised on a ranch in Mexico
and she brought with her those traditions. She has six siblings and she will be
the first to graduate from a university. Juanita has worked in the fields to help
her family. I had the honour to capture her grad pictures. In the back, you can
see her mother working. It made me so happy to see how proud her mother is
of her. Y su padre ha de estar muy orgulloso de lo que ella a logrado. Desde
el cielo ha de sonrefr y decir "esa es mi Juanita". Source:
