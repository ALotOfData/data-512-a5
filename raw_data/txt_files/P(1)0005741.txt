Meet Dr. Marie Daly, Black History's first Black woman biochemist.
In 1947, she became the first African-American woman to earn a Ph.D. in
Chemistry when she graduated from Columbia University.
Today, inspiring many young Black girls to become chemists, Dr. Daly
researched the connection between high cholesterol and heart disease.
Black excellence has a rich and powerful history.
