Ad Text 90-year-old WWII veteran is evicted on stretcher.
The WWII veteran Johnnie H. Hodges refused to leave his house after he was
not able to pay his mortgage while caring for his sick wife. Police and
ambulance workers had to carry him away on a stretcher.
A 90-year-old Navy veteran lived in his Buffalo home with his wife for
decades. But about four years ago; he was taking care of his wife, who had
Alzheimer's disease and spent all his income on her rehabilitation. In the
process, he defaulted on his mortgage and amassed a huge debt totaling
$73;000 to M&T Bank. Unfortunately, due to his default on his mortgage loan
payments, he was evicted from his house on a stretcher.
Why does the U.S. government treat military veterans absolutely
disgracefully? Why the WWII veterans are literally being treated like human
garbage by their own government? How potentially disabled veteran was
evicted from his house? How come homelessness and unemployment among
American veterans is much higher today than for the general population of the
United States of America?
