department. Brutality by police is enough, they said. Most of Christians from
different churches converged Sunday outside the Rogers Park District police
station with respect to police accountability. The event was one of the major
protests coordinated by the Community Renewal Society Sunday beckoning
city officials to adopt the FAIR COPS ordinance which would install an
independent auditor to check the mayor's authority on police matters. The
Christians believe that with their cry, a good results will come out of it.
