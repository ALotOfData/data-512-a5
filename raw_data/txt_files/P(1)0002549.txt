'TURNED THEM GAY'
Ruby Rose has recently shared her opinion on the people saying that she
"turned them gay". She gets hundreds of flirty messages every day and she
laughs at the idea that changes someone's sexuality.
Roby Rose thinks that it's not possible to change someone's sexuality
because it's something you're born with and it's not changeable.
I agree with her! Unfortunately, bigots like to say that homosexuality is a
choice, so it can be "cured". Just like Ben Carson thinks that you're choosing
to be gay and the prison is the proof of that. These ideas lead to thousands of
broken lives.
Why is it so hard to accept the fact that we were born this way?!
