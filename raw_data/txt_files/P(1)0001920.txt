Ad Text KKK, African-American group plan rallies at South Carolina Capitol
Could you please just close your eyes for a minute? Now, imagine... 70-years
after the Third Reich was down, Berlin organizes Nazi military parade.
Sounds weird; inconceivable right?
So tell me, why KKK march at South Carolina Capitol draws the ire only of
local African-Americans?
A Ku Klux Klan chapter and an African-American group plan overlapping
demonstrations on Saturday outside the South Carolina State House; where
state officials removed the Confederate battle flag last week.
We have been fought with slavery, Jim Crow laws and etc for REALLy long
time so what's the problem today? Nothing good coming out of this mess. So
what is the purpose of this march? Hmmm... It feels like this could be billed as
"the fight of the century." What do you think about it guys?
