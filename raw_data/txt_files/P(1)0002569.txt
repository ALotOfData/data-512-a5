Ad Text THE COLORFUL ACTIVISM OF NEW YORK'S MOST RADICAL QUEERS
These wonderful people creating a powerful community through progressive
politics, community gardens, wild parties, and colorful performance.
Call them the radical queers, and know that the term is flexible; and evolving.
From the local gardens of the East Village to Bushwick warehouses; a new
wave of New York artists; thinkers and activists young and old.
They are banding together to question and redefine what it means to be queer
today. It's beauty; perfection; freedom, and of course lots and lots of LOVE!
