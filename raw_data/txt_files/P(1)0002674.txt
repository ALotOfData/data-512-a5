Ad Text Austin's Robert E. Lee Elementary school has a new name: Russell Lee. The
Austin School Board voted 8-1 to change the name Monday night.The school
board had three name options from which to choose: Russell Lee, a
photographer from the school's neighborhood who started UT's photography
program. The board approved Russell Lee at the request of the school's
Campus Advisory Council.
So, what can I say? This is a disgrace for the Texas authorities!
I am shocked at the dismantling of southern history. We know that our
ancestors fought for our freedom. These names were, are and always will be
the part of Texas history.
Why is Texas administration willing to do anything what feds say them? Isn't it
obvious that the Federal government aims to destroy our history? This is a
madness!
Therefore, I need to ask you: are you ready to defend our Heritage? The
Southern history needs protection now more than ever before!
