endorsement of Trump. They claimed Donald is supported by David Duke and
"white supremacists". The journalists are trying to depict Trump as a racist
and continue their attempts even after Trump officially declared "I don't know
anything about David Duke... You're asking me a question that I'm supposed
to be talking people I know nothing about."
However, "for some reasons" the same mass media in their revelation
campaign forgot to mention Hillary Clinton's ties to Robert Byrd, a former
KKK leader. Hillary described him as a man of "surpassing eloquence and
nobility". In 2010 after Byrd died she released a tribute video saying "It is
almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd.
He was not just its longest-serving member; he was its heart, its soul, and its
historian. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he
was always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless
advocacy for his West Virginia constituents, his fierce defense of the
Constitution, and the traditions of the Senate, and his passion for a
government that improves the lives of the people it serves."
So here the mass media give us an political paradox: a Republican candidate
can't be endorsed by a former KKK member, but a Democrat can easily show
her respect and honor to a former racist leader without being judged for that.
Isn't that a little hypocritical?
