Ad Text Remember that terrible case when a student was forced by York
Comprehensive High School officials to remove the Old Glory from his
pickup? It happened in May 2015 and luckily had a happy end, as a result the
students were allowed to attach our flag to their vehicles.
The story ended well by efforts of dozens of patriots united to protest against
High School authorities. It was a peaceful but strong and confident protest
that made the authorities listen, it was a great example of how conscious
people should act. We have to keep ready to stand against all kinds of attacks
on American values and Constitutional laws.
Unfortunately our current Government approves and even provokes these
attacks, and the liberals' offensive and violent moods make it clear â€” every
American patriot has to be careful and attentive.
