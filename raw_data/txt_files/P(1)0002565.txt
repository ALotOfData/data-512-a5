Ad Text BACK IN LOVE! CAITLYN JENNER REPORTEDLY DATING FELLOW
TRANSGENDER WOMAN CANDIS CAYNE
It looks like 65-year-old reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner has found love again.
After getting divorced from Kris Jenner earlier this year, Caitlyn has not been
linked with any love interest.
According to reports, she is now dating Candis Cayne, 44, an actress and a
fellow transgender woman.
Caitlyn and Candis had amazing chemistry. After her monumental life change,
Caitlyn's ready to open up her heart again and really, how could you ask for
a more perfect fit as a romantic partner than Candis? She's been basically
through the same struggles and confusion, so she'd be the perfect person for
Caitlyn to lean on as she continues her journey of transition. Candis is smart,
funny, talented and drop-dead sexy!
