Ad Text "They wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike.
So do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of
Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find
them and take not from among them any ally or helper."(Qur'an 4:89)
This Surah is an evidence of how Syrian refugees respect our culture. If you
think that Muslims ignore some Islamic rules, you're wrong. For example, a
Muslim in eastern Uganda strangled his Christian wife to death this month for
leaving Islam.
What would you do if your wife or husband converts to Islam? Probably you
would be upset. In the worst case, you would sue for divorce. But I'm sure you
would not kill your spouse. That's the difference between our cultures.
