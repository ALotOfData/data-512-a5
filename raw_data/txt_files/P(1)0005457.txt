Ad Text At the Last Supper Jesus says:
He said to them,"But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if
you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one."
â€” Luke 22:36
What does that mean? Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But
enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always
was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be
followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need
of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would
be exposed to, and of their need of protection.
And we, American Christians, should remember about it. Sometimes you
have to arm yourself to protect your loved ones and friends.
