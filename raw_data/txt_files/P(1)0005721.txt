Ad Text Some people's contribution to the Black man's confidence in themselves
cannot be overlooked, Y'all remember Nichelle Nichols, popularly known as
Uhura?
Well Dr. Martin Luther King once pleaded that she reconsider her decision to
quit and stay on StarTrek because her role was so important to the
community.
Do you believe similar sacrifices from Black people in white supremacy
systems could really influence anything for the ordinary Black man?
