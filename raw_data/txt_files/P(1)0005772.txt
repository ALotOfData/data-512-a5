Ad Text Lemme take a minute of your time and remind you how much we are magical
on planet earth.
This little King right here, now probably 11-years (8-y-o in the pic.) recently
finished a Science Course at Imperial College London University was and still
reigns as the smartest kid on planet earth; studied at the Oxford University at
the age of 6.
And yes; he was too advanced for his required school grade so that lead him
into being homeschooled. He excels in Math, Foreign Languages; History,
Philosophy. IT and Science.
Now tell me Black people are not magic!
