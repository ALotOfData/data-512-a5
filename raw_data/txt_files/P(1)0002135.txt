shooting in Charleston, South Carolina.
Why the symbol of the pro-slavery rebellion is still flying on the ground of
South Carolina? Why the symbol of white supremacy is still flying on the
South Carolina statehouse in Columbia? Why the flag that represents the
murder of blacks was not removed from the national statehouse?
The confederate flag represents terrorism, reminding us about the slavery
time, racism and people that were murdered in a hate-crime. Today, we ask
to remove this symbol of racism that flies 120 miles away from the Emanuel
African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.
Yes, we must wipe off every single symbol of racism from the United States of
America including the confederate flag, KKK and other racist organizations.
We must give new names to the streets which were named after racist
political figures and slave traders. We must remove monuments dedicated to
Andrew Jackson, Robert Lee, Benjamin Huger, James Longstreet who owned
slaves on their farms.
How can we ever expect to get the racist symbols removed until we show
ourselves to be men the same as any other race of men?
