Ad Text Turning bureaucracy against themselves.
We have suffered a 40pc unemployment rate from layers of federal regulation
applied only to tribal lands, but it hasn't stop Fort Berthold from becoming
one of the state's most productive regions. Currently a coalition of Native
Americans appointed by to guide country's Indian policy is researching
proposals to make energy development easier on tribal lands - including the
idea of transferring them to private ownership. This way, big corporations
finally won't be allowed to rob and destroy our lands. We are strong not only
by our unparalleled unity, but also by our ability to see the bigger picture.
