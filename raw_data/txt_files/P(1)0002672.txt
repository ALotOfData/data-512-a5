Ad Text The police report that the Black Lives Matter terrorist sniper Micah Johnson
used to buildings owned by Muslim Arabs to carry his attack. If you think it
was just a coincidence, you make a mistake.
Johnson got set up in one building and moved more than 10 miles away to
another building owned by the same people to shoot from. It doesn't look like
it is a coincidence. Moreover, some witnesses said that they saw Jonson
visiting a mosque.
Muslims seem to be not peace-loving as they say. And I don't want to see
10.000 potential terrorists here in Texas.
