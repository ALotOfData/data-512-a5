Ad Text "Everyone should #buyblack this holiday season in an effort to support the
businesses that are the backbone of our neighborhoods and communities.
Often times, we overlook our own businesses to purchase products and
services from businesses outside of our communities. Many of us have heard
the disturbing statistic about a dollar circulating within the black community for
only 6 hours compared to approximately 2-4 weeks in white, Jewish, and
Asian communities. If we don't support our entrepreneurs, how can we
expect others to support our amazing businesses? We must continue to
educate and change the mindset of consumers so "buying black" becomes
the norm amongst our people and not only an encouragement during the
holiday season," said Lonzell Fogle and Breyon Williams, founders of My
Suited Life.
