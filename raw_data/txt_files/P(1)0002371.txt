Ad Text Frank Levingston, the oldest veteran in the United States, passed away
Tuesday. May 3 at the age of 110 at a nursing home for veterans in Bossier
Parish, La., according to family members.
Levingston was also the oldest man in the United States. He held the title for
less than a month following the death of Felix Simoneaux Jr. on April 19.
Wish our veterans received more attention and care from our Government.
Obama's eight presidency years turned into a disaster to our veterans and
soldiers. Hope Obama will be replaced by a President who cares.
We want our old heroes to be proud of their children and grandchildren so
they would leave this world with a smile. knowing they will be honored and
remembered.
