Ad Text Donald Trump is afraid that the 2016 general election will be "rigged" against
him. There's no doubt he has reasons to think so.
Hillary Clinton has already committed voter fraud during the Democrat Iowa
Caucus. At the same time, she has already demonstrated that she prefers
destroying the nation than losing election. She pledged not to deport illegal
aliens. Moreover, it's known that Hillary is going to take in about one million
Muslim refugees, if she is president.
"I'm telling you, Nov. 8, we'd better be careful, because that election is going
to be rigged," Mr. Trump said. "And I hope the Republicans are watching
closely or it's going to be taken away from us."
