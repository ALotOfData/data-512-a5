We found old dashcam footage has revealed the startling moment a Texas
trooper ran toward a motorcyclist following a high-speed chase, leaped into
the air and karate kicked him to the ground.
The incident unfolded in December 2012 after Martinez, a 10-year veteran
trooper, took chase when 25-year-old Steven Gaydos ran a stop sign near
Houston.
Apparently this Texas deputy wanted to go back to the good old days and
show off his fancy moves by jumping in the air and kicking this guy who was
already surrendering off his motorcycle.
Wow, bad cops with Rambo mentality issues should be dismissed and
forbidden from ever owning any firearm again. period!
