Ad Text California Attorney General ruled against the execution of gays and lesbians
A California judge argued against a proposed initiative about the execution of
gay and lesbian people, naming this measure "unconstitutional on its face."
The Sodomite Suppression Act proposes that "any person who willingly
touches another person of the same gender for purposes of sexual
gratification be put to death by bullets to the head or by any other convenient
method." The act also will outlaw advocating gay rights to minors.
California Attorney General Kamala Harris claimed that the proposal was
unconstitutional and it had no place in civil society. The proposal reminds me
the Inquisition. We live in a free and tolerate country! So even talks about
such an initiative should be immediately stopped. Where is our President?
Stop considering gays as naughty and not like all the others. We are all equal.
Despite all the arguments that the opponents of gay marriage call, polls show
that the majority of Americans stand for gay marriages. Why not to hold a
referendum as the Irish did? Why we should listen to conservatives?
