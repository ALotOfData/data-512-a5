Ad Text Hi guys! If there's no justice, there will be no peace. There's no way to
believe the lie instead of fighting for the truth. We must keep on fighting for
what we know is right. Many of our brothers had been killed by the police.
Still, we have no doubts that the justice will prevail. Remember the fallen, they
are waiting for our victory.
