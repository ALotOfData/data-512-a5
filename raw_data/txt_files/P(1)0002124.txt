Ad Text A 13-year-old child was tasered by cop for skateboarding
A San Diego sheriff's deputy was filmed tasering 13-year-old child in the
spine for skateboarding. Witnesses reported that the cop tried to force them to
delete videos from their phones. Videos show how the child writhes in agony
from being tased. Police said that the child ran away from home and was
missing for a day-and-half. However it doesn't give the reason to taser a
child.
We see another case of police misconduct, when the policeman actually
attacked the child. This case should reach the court, because the child hasn't
done anything unlawful. The policeman exceeded his powers and used force
against a child. So he should be punished. Before the trial nothing's gonna
change and cops are about to do whatever they want. The task of all
Americans who have witnessed police brutality is to extend all the information
about it in order to reach out the government and the court.
