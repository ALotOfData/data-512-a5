Ad Text Meet Joseph Wicks, the man whose biggest dream is to save old house in
downtown Charleston.
Joseph, a retired Pittsburgh firefighter, is moving an old house on Woolfe
Street that's being displaced by development says he's doing it to make a
statement.
"It was something that I really wanted to go into because it was something
that's not done here by black folk. said Joseph Wicks; who now owns the
house at 33 Woolfe St. `None of the historic revitalization is ever targeted
toward black folk."
Wicks says he has seen Blacks moved out of downtown neighborhoods
because the development of the tourism in this area caused the increasing of
home prices and made taxes unaffordable for most.
The reason why Wicks bought this house is that it was built in 1840 and it
cant be torn down!
I'm so proud of this man! He is making a real movement! Actions like this can
protect our history!
