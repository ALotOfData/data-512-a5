Ad Text An NYPD sergeant Diana Pichardo that was named in at least 20 federal
lawsuits including an allegation of false arrest and police brutality, was caught
on a video grabbing a bystander's phone, arresting him without reason and
searching his home without a warrant. Instead of getting fired or arrested for
her actions, she is facing only a disciplinary review.
The victim's only crime was filming him while she was assaulting and
brutalizing his neighbors!
Though it's legal to film the police, cops are so scared of people recording
them. It means that we have to keep following them with our cameras. It's
our only way to prove that they were violent and it's our only hope for justice!
