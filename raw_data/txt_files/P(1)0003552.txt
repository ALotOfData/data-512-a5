Ad Text It's time to talk about important issues. We want to know what do you think
about police brutality against black women?
I wonder, why is no one talking about black women abused by police? At the
time when Americans' attention focuses primarily on the relationship between
black men and law enforcement, we've got to admit the fact that Black women
have a tough time too.
To my mind it should come to national spotlight; from teen girl, who was
slammed to the floor in a South Carolina classroom to the mysterious death of
Sandra Bland in a jail cell. We want to give you a chance to express yourself
and share your minds with us.
WATCH the video below, showing black women bringing their problems to the
forefront.
