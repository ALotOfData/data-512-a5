Today is 16th of July. The Apollo 11, the first U.S. lunar landing mission, is
launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on this day in 1969. It was a great
day in history! Americans are first and only who landed on the moon till today.
We are the great nation! And we have to go forward with our head high!
