Ad Text McKinney Police Officer Involved In Pool Party Incident
Eric Casebolt, the McKinney, police officer who was caught on video pinning
a teenage girl to the ground and pulling his gun on others at a pool party, has
resigned Tuesday evening.
The McKinney Police Department, Chief Of Police Greg Conley said that
Casebolt's decision to leave was voluntary and that he would continue to
collect a pension and benefits.
Why are the police so aggressive? It's in every state around the country. The
young girl at the pool party was treated horrible. Our society needs police,
good police, people who will solve crimes but, unfortunately, today we need
someone who will protect us from the police. At the same time, it is good that
millions of regular people got a glimpse of what kind of policing minorities
have endured for decades.
