Ad Text As we celebrate and reflect upon the birth of the great Martin Luther King Jr.,
a voice of the people and one who sacrificed his life for the total liberation of
Black Americans, the question is "who will keep his dream alive"?
He saw the promise-land where blacks and whites live together in harmony
and each of them given equal rights and privileges, freedom and justice.
Today, we do not see this equality among blacks and whites in America.
These rights and privileges, freedom and justice shouldn't be for some
selected few but all!
