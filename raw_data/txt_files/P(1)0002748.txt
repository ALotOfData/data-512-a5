Ad Text Obama is a total hypocrite and a liar! He visited the Dallas memorial service
to blame us of racism. He just had to turn a ceremony honoring the fallen
officers into a disgraceful. He doesn't care about fallen officers! Obama is not
our leader!
Texans have already honored our heroes, laying flowers at Dallas police
headquarters. But Obama's speech did not make sense at all. That's why we
have to support all police officers who refused to applaud Obama.
Taking sides with these rioters and racists, Obama literally called for open war
against police officers and whites. He came there and he lectured officers
who are targeted every day for assassination by Black Lives Matter that they
need to change. Kick this asshole out of Texas!
