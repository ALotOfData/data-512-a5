Ad Text This is enough, police officers! No more Eric Gartners!
More than twenty protesters organized by the Mass Action Against Police
Brutality group are calling for a further investigation into videotaped incident
that took place in Washington Street in Roslindale. Nearly three-minute
videotape posted to Youtube shows Boston Police officer earlier this month
choking an 18-year-old Elvin Vargas and attempting to put him in a cruiser
after he was arrested on August 16.
Have you noticed than excessive force by police is disproportionate on people
of color? When the government, law enforcement, the criminal justice system
will treat all communities with dignity? How long should we complain about
threats against our lives? As the ability to record police activity has become
more widespread, can we achieve justice?
