culture of gun violence and racism
35-mile trek to Washington has started this Sunday evening in order to bring
more attention to widespread violence in different cities across America. The
founder of the group Munir Bahar said that the march will last 20 hours in a
memory of more than 200 people who have been killed in Baltimore this year.
The 300 Men March will highlight the racism and violence across the country.
What's wrong with our society? Police kill unarmed citizens, we kill each
other. What example we will be setting for the future generations? How are
we going to break the cycle of violence? Are there any chances to overcome
deeply rooted racism and violence in America? What if peace comes after the
fairness?
