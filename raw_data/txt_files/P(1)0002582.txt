Ad Text First LGBT studies course opens in a San Francisco high school
A San Francisco high school may be the first US school to offer an LGBT
studies course. The course will teach terminology and the history of LGBT
movement.
"We'll look at what it's been like for gay men, what it's been like for lesbian
women, what it's been like for transgender people," Ruth Asawa High School
Social Studies teacher Lyndsey Schlax told. Schlax has been working with
Cleve Jones, a human rights activist, who was mentored by Harvey Milk.
It is proposed that the class will begin in autumn. Really perfect idea! There
are at least twenty eight percent of LGBT students in Asawa High School. It is
the fact that we need such classes in every American school! Children
shouldn't be afraid to show who they are; they shouldn't be afraid to speak
about LGBT history; they should know that it is normal to be gay or lesbian or
transgender. Everybody should be taught to understand LGBT people and
recognize them as ordinary citizens.
