Ad Text The Battle of Okinawa, codenamed Operation Iceberg, came to the end on
June 22, 1945. The operation was fought on the Ryukyu Islands of Okinawa
and included the largest amphibious assault in the Pacific War during World
War II. The military value of Okinawa "exceeded all hope." Okinawa provided
a fleet anchorage, troop staging areas, and airfields in close proximity to
Japan.
