Ad Text Prominent Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King revealed to be white
Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King has claimed for years that he is
biracial, being born to a white mother and a black father. But recently
uncovered records claim he misled the public about his race, and that he is in
fact a white man pretending to be black.
King's race would not be under scrutiny if it was not an essential component
of his career, education and social status. In addition to getting a full-ride
scholarship that is exclusively for black men, King has the position of "Justice
Columnist" at progressive news website Daily Kos and enjoys a
169,000-strong follower count on Twitter, most of whom are a result of his
activism following the death of Mike Brown in Ferguson.

King still did not directly answer the simple yes or no question about his ethnic
background: Are you black? Instead, he said, "If you have known me from
when I was in elementary school at Huntertown Elementary until now, you've
known me as black or bi-racial."
Turning blackness into a performance is anti-blacknessâ€”irrespective of
whether the white person doing it is Rachel Dolezal or Shaun King.
