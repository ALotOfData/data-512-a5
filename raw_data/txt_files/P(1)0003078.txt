On October 10, 2015 in Washington, D.C., at the National Mall, The
Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan will convene the 20th Anniversary of the
Million Man March under the theme: Justice or Else!
"The Million Man March was one of the most historic organizing and
mobilizing events in the history of Black people in the United States," said
Chicago-based Dr. Conrad Worrill, who was a main organizer of the March
and the current president emeritus of the National United Black Front.
The widespread death, rising racism, mob attacks and police brutality on
Blacks coupled with economic deprivation and stark poverty, requires that
something must be immediately done to address and correct the condition.
We should stop the violence and the killings and present ourselves as a
united front before the Government of the United States of America. Fredrick
Douglas said " Power concedes nothing except by a demand". Our demand
of government must be backed by the power of our unity and love of the
brotherhood.
It's really important for all of us, brothers and sisters.
