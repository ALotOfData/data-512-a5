Closeted minor leaguer for St Louis Cardinals quit after coach and players
spoke of killing gay people
Tyler Dunnington was a 28th-round pick by the St Louis Cardinals in the 2014
Major League Baseball draft and given a chance to pursue his dream of being
in the big leagues. But after just one season pitching for a Cardinals minor
league team and performing solidly, Dunnington quit. He explains that during
his playing days, he was a closeted gay man playing in an uncomfortable
environment. A particular low point came when a coach made a bragging
reference to the brutal murder in Wyoming of gay college student Matthew
Shepard whose death led to federal hate crime legislation in the US.
And the hate goes on and on and on....You need fight back! It's a shame all
those "big strong men" are afraid of what somebody does in private!!
