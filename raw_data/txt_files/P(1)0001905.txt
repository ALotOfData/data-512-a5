Ad Text Ta-Nehisi Coates on growing up in West Baltimore
The famous African-American writer Ta-Nehisi Coates grew up in West
Baltimore with people who lost a child whether to the streets, to guns or to jail.
Today, his goal is to protect his son from the different forms of violence that
he experienced in school and on the streets.
People of color have been dealing with injustice ever since they crossed the
North American continent. For instance, in West Baltimore, Ta-Nehisi was
trained not to go to the neighborhoods unless you know this place. He was
told that you cannot tolerate anybody attempting any physically violent threat
to you. Moreover, his mom was feared that her children would get arrested.
What does it mean? Undoubtedly, black Americans were afraid of police,
improper procedure, injustice or what is worse, being killed by police officer.
That's why the nationwide furor over the growing number of unarmed black
men fatally shot by police officers has put the public on a new trend in
America. In fact, this new trend caused disproportionate number of unarmed
people of color killed by police.
