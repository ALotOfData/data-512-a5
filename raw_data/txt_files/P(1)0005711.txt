Ad Text When people haven't got clean water and it becomes something 'funny" for
another group of people simply because they are not affected, makes me sick
in the stomach.
This photo of Ohio State fans mocking Flint water crisis with sign isn't at all
funny in any way and they should be ashamed of themselves.
I know it might sound 'racist,' but these white people are heartless!
