Ad Text The Obama Administration turned a great idea of fighting terrorism into
drawing our country into another regime change venture. Our military
presence in Syria now doesn't serve American interests. Our soldiers are
there to fight and die for Globalists, Saudis and Israelis, but not for
Americans. And that's why we keep on talking about it: this policy is directly
opposite to the "America First" concept.
I believe Trump can fix it, just like he promised. Sadly days after days and
weeks after weeks of Trump's presidency there are no changes in that
direction. Israel captured a Syrian region named Golan Heights in 1967, and
today this land is internationally considered to be occupied territory. Israelis
want to use Trump's influence so the world would acknowledge Israeli
sovereignty. Trump is a dealer, and maybe he's trying make a deal out of it,
but there's one important thing here: under no circumstances can our
soldiers' lives be put at risk for that. So many times during the presidential
campaign Trump said "let's bring back our soldiers home", and now it's
really time to do it. This is not our war.
