Ad Text Boston police shot and killed a man wearing body armor and wielding an
assault rifle who critically injured two officers responding to a domestic
disturbance call late Wednesday, according to Police Commissioner William
Evans.
A gun battle raged at an East Boston home as a suspect, Kirk Figueroa, 33,
of East Boston, critically injured two Boston police officers late on October
12.He was then shot and killed by other officers who ran into the home to
drag out their wounded colleagues while undergoing heavy gunfire
themselves.
This bloody massacre is a vivid example of the fact that the war with police is
too far from being OVER. It's only coming and the consequences will be
destructive if Hillary Clinton, the main hardliner against cops, will become the
President of the United States.
Defending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of
every American Patriot. Recent spate of cop killings indicates that American
national identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments
liberal elites are constantly setting up on the country.
Democrats are unable to secure the police from attacks of extremist
movements like Black Lives Matter. The Nation must unite against reverse
racism, against those who want to destroy America!
Among all the candidates Donald Trump is the one and only who can defend
the police from terrorists.
