Ad Text BLACK DOCTOR WAS HELD AT GUNPOINT BY TROOPER WHILE
TRYING TO SAVE CRASH VICTIM.
Dr. Nicholson walked towards the scene of the accident with his scrubs, when
the trooper drew his gun screaming, "Get back! Get back"'
I guess, even today black people aren't afforded the same humanity as other
Americans.
