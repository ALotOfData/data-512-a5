Ad Text Only 9 days this year nobody was killed by police
According to data from Mapping Police Violence there are only 9 days this
calendar year when nobody was killed by police in the USA. Since January 1,
2015 at least 508 people have now been killed by policemen. Moreover,
analyzing all deaths caused by police, African-American and Hispanic people
are more likely to be killed than Whites. Figures show that the index of deaths
for black people is 3.45 per million, while for whites it is 1.26 per million. Add
here military-style equipment and non-lethal weapons, given to cops.
And only 0.02 per cent of the nation's police forces are investigated each
year. Only 0.02! That means, US policemen are immune from criminal
changes in their killings. That's why they carry out their daily police raids to
destroy the population at the territories under their control.
