Ad Text Vatican Says Transgender Man Cannot Become A Godparent
The Vatican has rejected a request by a transgender man in Spain to become
a godparent, ruling that his sexual identity means he is incapable of carrying
out the task.
Alex Salinas was asked by his family to be godfather to his nephew, but the
bishop of his local diocese on Spain's southern coast questioned his gender
identity.
Salinas was born a woman but has since undergone hormone therapy and
has a male ID in Spain. He is now waiting for gender surgery.
Bishop Rafael Zornoza Boy of Cadiz and Ceuta rejected the family's request
to name Salinas as a godfather. Then, after a media storm, the bishop wrote
to the Vatican for advice.
Zornoza published the Vatican's reasoning for rejecting Salinas' wish.
It said transsexual behavior "reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to
the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the
truth of one's own sexuality."
The pope supported gays, but now for some reason the transman wasn't
allowed to be a godfather in Spain, an entirely Catholic, but at the same time,
the most friendly country towards the LGBT community. Anyway it's just
another superstition of Church. Funny.
