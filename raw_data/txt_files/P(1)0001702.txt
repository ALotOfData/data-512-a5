Ad Text Weeks ago, we all witnessed the uniting of Black community at work when
social media alerts from Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department
ignited an outcry about the number of missing Black girls in the District.
But it is important to say that Black men are missing, too! At least 10 missing
teen boys and young men are also on that official missing-persons list.
If you care about your brothers and sisters, spread that information!
