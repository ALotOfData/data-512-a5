Louisiana Justice Refuses To Obey Supreme Court, Writes Opinion Implying
Gay People Rape Their Children
Raising children and starting a family is something that all people look forward
to in life! We are just people, not criminals! AND WE LOVE CHILDREN, NOT
RAPE!! We are all equal! It is better for child to live with homosexual parents
then to live on the street or in orphanage! Millions of children need love and
they don't care if our love is different. Why should we let those children that
are left on the streets be on the streets when a warm and open home are
open to them?! I don't understand!!
