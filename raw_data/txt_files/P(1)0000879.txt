Ad Text The Senate of the U.S. Congress approved a bill that seriously broadens the
scope of combat operations of the U.S. Armed Forces. According to this bill,
the U.S. will send far more soldiers to Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan and
similar countries. Since thousands of Mexican have served in the U.S. Army,
this law should never be implemented. Mexican soldiers shouldn't die in vain
for the sake of foreign political ambitions.
