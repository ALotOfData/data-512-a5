Ad Text Thousands Walk Hand In Hand Across Ravenel Bridge To Show Support For
Mother Emanuel Church
On Sunday evening, hours after Emanuel A.M.E. Church opened its doors for
the first service following the killing of nine of its congregants Wednesday,
thousands in Charleston took to the streets in a show of support and
solidarity.
Observers on the bridge, and thousands more at the base, joined hands to
create a "unity chain," then held a moment of silence that lasted five minutes
in honor of the fallen.
Police estimated that 10,000 to 15,000 took part in Sunday's gathering,
according to the Post and Courier. Cars drove slowly past the bridge, taking in
the sight and honking horns in solidarity as people chanted "Charleston
strong!"
Throughout history people start to unite only when they face danger or when
they're in times of great sorrow. Modern America is accustomed to meet only
imaginary dangers, however, Americans are getting more and more reasons
to sorrow over something day by day.
Does it mean that the key to the unity of 330 million Americans is constant
fear and unending sorrow? Does it mean that only this can make Americans
unite and forget about the infighting and differences? Unfortunately, yes, it
does.
