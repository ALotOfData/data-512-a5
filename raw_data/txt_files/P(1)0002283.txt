Ad Text We must ensure the Dallas attack on police will never happen again. Most
problems we face happen because we've stopped calling things by their
names and the assassination of cops in Dallas was no exception. We're
hiding behind political correctness and denying the truth because we don't
want to `offend' someone.
And the truth is: a group of people calling their supporters to commit violence
is not a peaceful group. A group of people coming to their opponent's rallies
and attacking peaceful people is a group of extremists. A group of people
standing behind the attack on police is a group of terrorists. The Black Lives
Matter are terrorists, and the sooner we admit it officially â€” the sooner this war
on cops will end and people running a conservative rally won't be afraid to be
attacked by a hateful gang.
