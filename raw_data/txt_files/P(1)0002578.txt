Ad Text The ninth transgender was found death in the USA
Transgender teen Mercedes Williamson was found dead in a wooded area.
She is the ninth confirmed transgender homicide victim in the USA this year.
Police in George County. Mississippi have charged a suspect Josh Brandon
Vallum. Police said that Mercedes and Josh knew each other, but it is not
clear if Vallum knew Williamson was a transgender. Jeanie Miller, whom
Williamson had been living with, said that Vallum knew that Williamson was
transgender.
Modern America is too dangerous for transgenders. This is the ninth
transgender killing based on gender identity. According to the National
Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs' report hate-motivated violence against
transgenders rose 13%. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to live as a
transgender in the South. Alabama even passed a religious freedom law in
1998 that allows discrimination against LGBT people. That also allows
lawmakers to justify hostility toward transgender people. And that we call
`freedom'? America is no longer land of freedom!
