Ad Text President Barack Obama signed a bill Friday eliminating the offensive and
outdated descriptors, after the legislation passed unanimously in the House
and Senate earlier this month. Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) sponsored the bill,
which aimed to "modernize" two references to "Orientals" and "Negros" in
the U.S. Code that date to the 1970's. The words will be replaced with "Asian
Americans" and "African Americans," respectively. "The term `Oriental' has
no place in federal law and at long last this insulting and outdated term will be
gone for good," Meng said in a statement on Friday. Obama signed the bill
shortly before leaving for his trip to Vietnam and Japan, where he will become
the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima.
