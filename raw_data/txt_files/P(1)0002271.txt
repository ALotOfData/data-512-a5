Ad Text A number of refugees has increased since Obama became the President
States across the country were filled with flows of refugees since Obama
became the President. The U.S. refugee admissions database wrapsnet.org
states that 437,829 new refugees came to the USA since Obama first took
office. Most of them were placed in Texas (46,351), California (44,162) and
New York (26,293). Many of refugees were placed in Ohio (14,855), Florida
(21,613), Virginia (9,395), Colorado (11,300) and Nevada (3,421).
Such active provision of a shelter for refugees sooner or later will lead to the
fact that the number of terrorist attacks in the USA will increase. The US
Homeland Security Committee considers that the administration is admitting
too many refugees from Iraq and Syria, a hotbed of ISIS terrorism. Perhaps
new terrorist attacks won't be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more
terrorist attacks if the immigration policy won't be tightened.
We have a lot of problems that require an active response and decisions from
the government: poverty, the problems of veterans, homelessness, racism,
law enforcement system and so on. Is it possible to offer a better life for
refugees if not all US citizens live normally?
