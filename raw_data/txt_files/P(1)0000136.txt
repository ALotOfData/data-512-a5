Ad Text Is here anyone from Glendale, Arizona? WE NEED YOU! HELP US to protect
the memory of the victims of hate!
Last week on Friday, May Kieu and Dorothy Dutiel, both 15-year-old
sophomores at Independence High School in Glendale, each died of a single
gunshot wound about 8 a.m. just outside the school's cafeteria. The girls
were a couple. Police are calling it a murder-suicide. This heart-breaking
incident is all over the news and the comments are disgusting! Homophobes
use the incident as a proof that love is a sin!
This is just ignorance! Two children died and people are grieving! How would
you feel if strangers came to your neighborhood or your school to push their
agenda? These people are just aggravating the situation and traumatizing
other KIDS!
