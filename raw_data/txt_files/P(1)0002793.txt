Ad Text VIDEO: TEXAS SCHOOL TEACHER FIRED AFTER MANHANDLING
LITTLE BLACK BOY
The shocking video shows a Central Texas child trying to get up from a bean
bag chair in his classroom, while a Snook Independent School District
employee, Troy Vann pushing him repeatedly into it and mocking him again
and again.
After the concerned parent posted a disturbing video showing teacher
manhandling a small child on Facebook, the video went viral and it was
shared thousands of times.
In the video footage, Vann also tells the boy: "Tell me no. When I tell you to
do something, you do it, boy."
After the Burleson County Sheriff's Office launched an investigation, a
"behavior specialist" who acted in an inappropriate manner with a young
student was fired.
The school district should provide a safe and secure environment for the
students. And the school should not condone or tolerate the employees who
abuse any child. The teachers who use excessive force against any child
should be removed immediately from the classroom and placed on
administrative leave. Otherwise, this will continue to happen.
