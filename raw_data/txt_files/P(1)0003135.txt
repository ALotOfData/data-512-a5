Ad Text What happened in Manchester is a tragedy beyond description that filled our
hearts with inconsolable grief of pain and loss. It makes everything worse that
the spirit of hatred is again aimed on all Muslims who in fact have nothing to
do with disgusting radicals who organize such gruesome acts. The whole
Muslim community condemns terror! Islam would remain the religion of peace
no matter how hard those terrorists try to promote the opposite image! These
people hurt Islam and the best way we can protect it is the art of compassion
and love towards all people suffering at the hands of radicals! Pray for the
victims, stay strong and heal this world!
