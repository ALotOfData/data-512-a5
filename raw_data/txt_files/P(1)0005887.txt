Ad Text Before he became a lawyer and prolific supporter of prisoner rights, Daniel
Manville spent three years and four months in the slammer for manslaughter.
Manville continued to study while incarcerated and eventually earned two
college degrees during his sentence. He became enamored with the legal
profession and went to law school right after his parole.
He finally passed the bar exams in Michigan and Washington, DC after
waiting many years to be approved by the respective boards. Afterwards,
Manville worked tirelessly to improve the prison system and represented
various inmates and prison guards in civil cases. Nowadays, Manville teaches
law at Michigan State University, where he hopes the insights he shares with
students inspire them to someday help improve the system as well.
