Ad Text Matt Cage comes out as gay
The pro wrestler Matt Cage, known as 'Money' publicly announced that he is
gay in a Facebook post. Previously Matt Hullum identified himself as bisexual.
Sorry, ladies. I'm officially pulling myself off of the market. Don't hate me too
bad.'
'I truly have nothing to hide anymore,' he wrote. 'I spent the majority of my life
lying, hiding and depressed because I felt like I couldn't truly be who I wanted
to be and live freely as I saw fit. I had to act and that's not me. I, nor anyone
else, should have to do that.'
Matt decided to tell the truth publicly because of speculation that was going
behind his back. This news should please all progressive humanity because
the coming-out once again confirms the fact that homosexuality and
masculinity are a perfect combination and do not contradict each other.
