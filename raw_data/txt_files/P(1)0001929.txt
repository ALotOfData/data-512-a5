Ad Text Who said that protesting is not effective? Yes, it is!
How many black people were killed and shot by police department for the
past few years? How many protests have been held since 2013? How useful
were protests?
According to analysis by AP, 24 states have put 40 new laws to tackle police
violence such as use of police officer body cameras, racial-bias training and
surplus of military equipment. However, there is more work to be done to
solve racial tensions in America.
The public stand against discrimination happens when there is lack of inside
connections with the government. People attempt to stop racism the
government usually assumes to be problematic but protesters force the
government to find compromise. It's a well known fact, when governments do
not deliver, people protest.
