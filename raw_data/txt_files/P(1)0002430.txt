Ad Text Since the game of American football was first played at the collegiate level in
the late 1860s, the sport has captivated fans by using both strength and
strategy to get the win. With the introduction of the American Professional
Football Association, later renamed to the National Football League,
audiences saw athletes play more ferociously than ever before. American
football has actually became national kind of sports in the United States. We
are proud of such players as Michael Vick, Peyton Manning and John Elway.
We are proud we live in America!
