Ad Text 'We want our chief back'
Last week, in a place that bills itself as the "Friendliest Town on the Eastern
Shore," angry residents marched to City Hall, demanding to give back a job
for Kelvin Sewell, the community's first black police chief.
On June 29 he was fired amid allegations leveled against white officers of
departmental racism. After that the crowd of Sewell's supporters moved to
voice their outrage to the Pocomoke City Council with posters that read "We
Support Chief Kelvin Sewell."
As a nation we have looked the other way for far too long and it is disgraceful!
This time we're not fighting with police, we're fighting for justice. The system is
broken, police doesn't protect us and the government cares only about
tycoons' interests. So here's a question - who will care about Americans who
can't protect themselves? Who will care about us?
