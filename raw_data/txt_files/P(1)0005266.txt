Ad Text Irma Gonzalez was one of six women inducted into the San Diego County
Women's Hall of Fame earlier this month. This is a huge step for a latino
woman in the US. She says: "Diversity on the bench is so important because
the people that come to court come from all different walks of life, different
ethnic backgrounds, different religious backgrounds."
However, if it's a sign of diversity, this is a very weak sign. Just think, we are
indigenous inhabitants of this land and we were cut off all privileges since
gabachos came and stole our land. So, it took almost 500 years for our
woman to reach a prestigious position in the government that is not really
caring about us! Whether there are latinos or not, authorities will continue to
deport us from our indigenous land!
