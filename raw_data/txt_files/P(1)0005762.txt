Ad Text There's a lot of mythology surrounding redheaded people, but one ignorant
assumption trumps them all: Redheads are white.
The reality? They're not.
Photographer @IamMichelleMarshall is raising awareness of this fact through
her photo series "M1 CR" the series, named after the gene variant responsible
for red hair and freckles, features individuals of Afro-Caribbean descent who
carry this gene and, therefore, embody certain aesthetic traits associated with
redheads."
