Rodney Sumter Jr., 27 miraculously survived Pulse nightclub Orlando
shooting, being shot three times. But he's still in a lot of pain.
Rodney is still recovering at Orlando Regional Medical Center. Lenita Sumter,
his mother, said he is in intense pain and that it has been difficult for him to
get comfortable and is needing sedation and heavy pain medications.
Rodney was shot in the arms and back. He had surgery Monday to repair his
arms, but shrapnel was left in his back. He had another surgery Wednesday
night, family said.
Doctors said Rodney is running a fever and suspect he may have an
infection.
Please help Rodney Sumter to recover!
