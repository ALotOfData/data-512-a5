Ad Text On the national level, the suicide risk for gay, lesbian and transgender youth
is far higher than it is among straight youth.
LGBTQ youth actively plan suicide at a 2.6 times greater rate than straight
youth.
LGBTQ youth attempt suicide at a 4.0 times greater rate than straight youth.
LGBTQ youth require medical attention for suicide attempts at a 5.1 times
greater rate than straight youth.
Behind these numbers are countless lives lost.
This has to stop!
Discuss problems together â€” but only at the initiative of the youth. Be caring
and supportive discussing these issues. Don't sweep the problems "under the
carpet"!
