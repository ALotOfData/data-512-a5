Ad ID 326
Ad Text Since 2010, over 350 of our lives have been taken at the hands of police.
Those lives of which, were made to be worthless because of our race. Each
time we die, many of your people, and those who stand by you, justify the
taking of our lives, because they believe we are not human, and are not
worthy of life.
Why should we be a target for police violence and harassment?
