Ad Text Just a reminder;
Never forget that the black panthers group was only formed to protect Black
people from the kkk, who used to kill Black people like animals. ??
However. the Black Panthers was dismantled by the US govt.. but the kkk still
exists today.
No, tell me this ain't about race.
Better still, tell me why is this so?
