Ad Text A 21-year-old Oklahoma man was sentenced on Monday to 40 years in prison
for sexually assaulting orphaned children while on a missionary trip in Kenya
in 2014. Matthew works at an orphanage built and run by an American citizen
named Upendo Children Centre. The main aim of this orphanage was to
assist abandoned children in Nairobi, Kenya. Upon Matthew's arrival in
Kenya, he insisted on not staying in the apartment allocated to him by
authorities but preferred to stay in the very dormitory where these children
stayed. He also based his choice on being in a better position to assist the
children should the need arise. Mathew raped three teenagers â€” ages of 5, 9,
and 15 respectively for not less than 8 times. He also maltreated a 12 year old
boy. This outrageous act led to his sentence of 40 years imprisonment and a
fined of $15, 863.
