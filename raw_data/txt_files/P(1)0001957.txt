Ad Text All lives matter? All lives mattered during slavery too. All lives mattered during
segregation too. All lives mattered during apartheid too. All lives always
matter. But there are situations, where some lives are focused more on during
that time. Not because they matter MORE, but because they're not put on an
equal playing field, not treated the same way, and are treated like they're
less/matter less.
