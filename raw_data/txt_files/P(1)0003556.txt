Ad Text Try to guess what would cops do, if you were back talking? Right, couple of
punches, some kicks and dozens of bruises for memory, here's a proof..
In a video you can see a cop who brutally attacked a teenager for what?
Hmmm, who knows... I bet, cop apologist will say the kid was in the wrong for
"back talking" how dare he insults his master, but seriously, it's a human
instinct to resist when someone throwing you around like a rag doll. This cops
an a$$hole.
Could you imagine that was your child? What would you do, if something like
that has happened to you kid?
