Ad Text The Civil Rights Movement was fighting for the real equality in general and
particularly the equal rights of voting. It started in North Carolina but it can
spread all over the country. Blacks are being deprived of general voting rights.
The U.S. District Judge, Thomas Schroeder, on Monday dismissed lawsuits
challenging changes to the state's election laws, declaring that the
challenges failed to show that it hindered voters of color from exercising their
voting rights. The North Carolina law which eliminated early voting, same
â€”day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting requires voters who go to
the polls to show an acceptable form of identification such as a driver's
license, passport or military ID. This is not a good sign as we watch the world
take the new turn for the worse now while doing nothing.
