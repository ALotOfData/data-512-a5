Ad Text Sometimes people say I criticize the government too much. They say I can't
see positive moments. In fact, I see all good things in the United States, and
I'm proud to be an American. But I reckon that I can't have the right to keep
silence when outrageous things happen.
I can't keep silence while stupid idiots forbid our children to wear patriotic
clothes. I can't keep silence while Obama creates comfortable conditions for
terrorists, accepting of 10,000 Syrian refugees. I can't keep silence while
liberals spit on the U.S. Constitution.
Yes, I criticize everything what is unacceptable for the nation. If Americans
turn a blind eye to outrageous things, enjoying only positive moments of their
lives, we will never live better. Criticism is a way for development. I'm a
patriot, that's why I criticize.
