Ad Text Teen shot by St. Louis police paralyzed; mom laments gun violence
A teenager shot by city police is paralyzed below the waist, his mother said
Sunday as her family copes with another episode of gun violence. Not seven
years ago, her teenage daughter was accidentally shot to death.
This time, a firearm in the hand of her son, Brandon Claxton, 16, prompted an
officer to shoot him three times about 7:15 p.m. Saturday in a housing
complex in the 2500 block of Hodiamont Avenue, officials said. Police
encountered him while responding to a call about someone with a stolen
pistol.
His mother said that she respected the police and that her son "shouldn't
have had the gun." But from what witnesses have told her, she said, "They
didn't have to shoot him down like that."
One of three witnesses interviewed Sunday told a reporter that Brandon did
have a gun in his hand. But all three said that he did not point a weapon at
anyone as he tried to run from officers.
When a white guy walks around with a rifle, nobody bats an eye. When a
black guy walks with a pistol (or even a toy gun)- he'll be immediately shot by
the police. Have you ever heard about open carry in the United States? Then
here we go. Racial prejudice at its finest.
Our condolences to the family.
