Ad Text Amandla Stenberg: Black Female Bodies Are Treated As Less Than Human
"Do black females lives matter, too?"
That's the big question 16-year-old Amandla Stenberg posed on Instagram on
Sunday. The powerful post broke down the cultural double standards that
plague black women every day.
"Black features are beautiful, black women are not," Stenberg wrote. "White
women are paragons of virtue and desire, black women are objects of
fetishism and brutality. This, at least, seems to be the mentality surrounding
black femininity and beauty in a society built upon eurocentric beauty
standards."
Everybody knows that racism is alive and prospering in America. However, all
the news about killing black men and black teenagers, police brutality, unfair
sentences and other issues, distract us from the fact that black women are
being abused in the most violent ways. Usually they can't stand up for
themselves unlike men, so they endure and suffer.
In modern America black women experience more depression than probably
during slavery, when everything was obvious, but now racism is hidden
behind the mask of tolerance.
