Ad Text A young black guy who was mentally disabled decided to end his life, but will
only do that by making the cops kill him. This is absolutely insane in the
highest order. He took a gun and ordered his other two brothers to take a
video of the whole incident. Michael Ford, at the police vicinity opened fire
and got the cop's attention. The filming was still in process as he
commanded. The first cops who appeared fired back and almost immediately
ended up drawing fire. He gave the other officer a chance to get into position
when he opened fire. It's quite not understandable why his own cop shot him
and shot the mentality ill man too. This is a good example of sick reality too. Is
there any explanation why cops have started shooting each other?
