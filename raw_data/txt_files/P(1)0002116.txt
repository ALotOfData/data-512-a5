Ad Text American Racists On The Road
The racists group of America "Back To The Blue" are organizing a hate rally
in response to the public outcry and protests against police officers.
"Bikers-patriots" want to descend on the McKinney Police HQ in a show of
solidarity for the police because race-baiters and cop-haters. They plan to
have "the biggest thing to happen in Patriot Movement since the Bundy
Ranch victory!"
It seems like we won't get into "post-racial America".... this event and the
regular murder of innocent Black children by white supremacist police and
citizens makes that clear. The modern government has brought racist
America to the forefront, good or bad. This is something that America has a
serious issue with - RACISM!
Is it time to call out the national guard?
