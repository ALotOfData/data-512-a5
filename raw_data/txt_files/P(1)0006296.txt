Ad Text Hey what's up buds! Let's continue to preserve our history from substitution. It
is well-known how libtards are eager to blame our forefathers for being racist.
Yet they always forget to underpin their empty words with facts. Not like all
these SJWs, let's refer to racial discrimination in the army of Union. A black
soldier was paid $10 a month with a $3 clothing fee taken out, while a white
soldier was paid $13 a month but was not forced to pay a clothing allowance.
Almost a twofold difference! How tolerant tho! And what was going on in the
"racist" Confederate States Army? Every soldier was paid $11/month until
1864 regardless of his skin color. Click to Learn More! #southunited South
