Ad Text Oh God! Just remember: you know you're doing something right when all the
bigots and racist idiots are angry with you...
For decades, conservative Christians who oppose LGBT equality have
singled out the federal government or secular atheists as their preferred
enemy in public settings, blasting both groups for supposedly attacking
"traditional marriage" or infringing on their religious liberty.
Yet in the months surrounding the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to
legalize same-sex marriage across the country, right-wing Christians have
become increasingly willing to cast blame — seemingly hypocritically — on a
group they have often dismissed or outright ignored: Progressive Christians,
especially those who support marriage equality.
I believe religions should teach love, they must stop teaching hatred! And
noticed while progressive Christians are constantly under attack from
conservative Christians, they're not the ones screaming "persecution". They
are just tired of the persecution.
