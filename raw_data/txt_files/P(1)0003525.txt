Ad Text Horrifying video shows inmate being shocked three times with a stun gun
Recently released video shows the moment officers shot 24-year-old Brandon
Bethea with a stun gun as he was in a jail cell.
Jail officers said Bethea had threatened them and that's why he was hit with
a stun gun but I guess cops didn't know the camera was recording them.
FIVE OFFICERS stood over Bethea and just watching how Clark pulled the
trigger two more times. As usual, no charges were ever filed against the
officers involved in Bethea's death.
There is no doubt that Bethea was murdered. Have you noticed that it took 20
minutes passed by before another officer summoned a nurse and they
attempted to revive Bethea. All of bastard cops who were there should be in
prison for murder. America, it's not a black or white problem... but a blue one.
