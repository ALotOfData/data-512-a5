Ad Text What is the second amendment for you? It's not just the right to bear arms.
It's respect to American history. The Founding Fathers were very smart
people. And it may be assumed they were smarter than many liberals.
The second amendment is deterrent. If a criminal knows you have a gun, he
doesn't want to rob you. Of course, not all Americans have a gun, but
criminals don't know who is unarmed. Liberals can say that guns increase
crime rate. In fact, it is nonsense. Look at statistics: the most gun-friendly
state is Wyoming, and it has low crime-rate.
The states with high crime rate are states where there are many illegals as
usual. So, liberal hysteria is just foolishness. Liberals find reasons of crimes in
wrong places.
The U.S. Constitution should be saved. Do you agree?
