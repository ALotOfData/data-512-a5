Ad Text Oh happy day! More and more of the "morally superior" cult members tripping
over their sex scandals!
Former Archbishop John Neinstedt is "dumbfounded" by allegations that he
frequented gay clubs, used " poppers," and made sexual advances on men.
Neinstedt has called homosexuality "evil' in the past, and thinks equal
marriage laws are a Satanic "man-made experiment' that would harm
children.
Oh, look at this! So much for humility... just another poor white Christian
"victim"! His Assholiness can play dumb for just so long before it all comes out
in the open..
