Ad Text Bob Miranda-Boulay, Camp Lejeune Marine reservist, suffers serious health
issues after exposure to tainted water. And he's not the only one!
Approximately 30,000 Marine Reservists may have suffered the same kind of
exposure.
Where were the liberals shouting about ecological problems? Why do they
care about shutting down the coal industry to avoid mysterious unproved
global warming but they don't mind thousands of Americans drinking
poisoned water?
Neither the VA officials nor our military commanders helped our Marines and
now they just feel abandoned. Bob Miranda-Boulay said `I don't count' â€” that
is what our veterans feel. That is not an attitude they deserve.
"I wanted to make a difference," Boulay said. "I love my country and I wanted
to do the right thing. I wanted to be a Marine." That is a real shame our
veterans feel being betrayed by our country leaders.
