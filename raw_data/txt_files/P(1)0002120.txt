Ad Text Today we celebrate the legendary rapper who ever lived: Happy B-day,
Tupac!
The greatest of all time rapper is known not only for his music but for the wise
words he spoke and his strength in standing up against oppression. His real
name was Lesane Parish Crooks. Shakur was only 25 years old at the time
he was shot and killed in 1996. His killer has never been caught. We will
never forget 2Pac. Today we remember him on what would've been his 44th
Birthday.
