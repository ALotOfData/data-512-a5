Ad Text Syrian refugees are not even trying to be modest and grateful for our help.
They are bluntly invading western world and demanding upmost respect for
their religion, while completely disrespecting and disregarding western values.
They are not victims of war; they are the war itself. We need to protect
ourselves from this menace by deporting all the refugees we have and
refusing to take any more of them.
