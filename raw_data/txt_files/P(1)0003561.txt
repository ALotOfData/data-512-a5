Ad Text That's crazy!'' Cops hold man down and sic K-9 on him for dancing in a
parking lot
The city will pay Linson Tara $100,000 to settle a civil-rights lawsuit filed after
the Washington cops used Tasers; their fists and then a police dog on him
while he was being restrained. Only 100k? Seriously? Guys, don't you think
it's not enough for a man who was choked; tased, punched in the face several
times while the dog bit you? It should be more zeroes in the number.
A dash cam video showed one of the officers holding Tara on the hood of the
police cruiser while his partner used a Taser on him. IS THAT THE WAY YOU
WANT POLICE TO TREAT US? The video gives us a great explanation of the
question, why do people hate cops?
Dear Americans, we've got to understand a simple idea - nothing will change
unless you, me and the whole country start taking judgments out of THEIR
paychecks... and then you'll see this behavior stop.
