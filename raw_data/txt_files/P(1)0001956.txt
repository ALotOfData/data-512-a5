Ad Text Jamycheal Mitchell: Mentally III, Criminalized. and Killed by the System
Stories like the one of Jamycheal Mitchell, the 24-year-old young man who
was found dead in his jail cell on August 19, are particularly hard to hear.
What the police ruled "natural causes" turned out to be that he starved to
death. The crime? Shoplifting. Mitchell. who had a severe mental illness had
been ruled permanently disabled and was unable to work. In April, he stole a
zebra cake. a Snickers, and Mountain Dew from a local 7-11 in Portsmouth;
Virginia. It would be a month before he ever went before a judge.
A judge then ruled him incompetent to stand trial. He should have been
transported to a local mental health facility, but he wasn't. Apparently there
wasn't one that had room for him. Three months later he was found dead in
his cell. No meds had ever been administered. He had never made it to a
mental health facility. He had lost nearly 80 pounds because he refused to
eat. All for less than $5 worth of snacks he stole while in a mental health
crisis.
Yes; you can die over 5 dollars here in America. Nothing new here. Justice is
just an empty word in this country. Be sure, you will never know the truth. We
are far away from the truth.
