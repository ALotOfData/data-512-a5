Ad Text The Justice Department is set to release about 6,000 inmates from federal
prisons in a bid to reduce overcrowding. It is the largest one-time release of
federal prisoners. The Department will release drug offenders who received
harsh sentences over the last three decades. Every third of them is illegal
immigrant.
Barack Obama has criticized overblown sentencing laws that
"disproportionately impact communities of color." But is it indeed a reason to
release criminals? If Latinos commit crimes often than whites, it doesn't
mean that some Latino criminals should escape penalty.
