Ad Text 'THAT'S NOT WHAT I AM': TRANSGENDER PERSON FIGHTS TO
CHANGE 'F' TO 'M' ON DRIVER'S LICENSE.
One of the friends of our group shared his story with us! He has been
discriminated against by local authorities in Louisville, Ky.
There's a gap between Kentucky law and federal law. People trying to change
the gender on a passport only need to be in transition, not post-surgery.
But many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical
reasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these
people's circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats.
It is very important for every transgender to be able to change his\her
identification to reflect who they really are. It's not just about person dressed
as a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is
about much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man
or woman only presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they
were assigned to at birth.
Transgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification
changes. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible.
Because it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you
were assigned to at birth.
Please share your stories with us, because united we can stand against
injustice and inequality!
