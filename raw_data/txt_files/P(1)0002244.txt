Ad Text Autopsy Says Freddie Gray Died After Sustaining 'High-Energy Injury' in
Police Van
The Baltimore state medical examiner's office has found that Freddie Gray
likely died from a single "high-energy injury" sustained as he rode shackled in
the back of a police van on the day of his arrest, according to an autopsy
report obtained by the Baltimore Sun.
The autopsy report suggested that Gray may have attempted to stand up
during the van ride, and that the injury could have occurred as he was thrown
against the van wall when the vehicle changed direction. Like really? When
police took Gray to the hospital, doctors determined that he had sustained a
severed spine and crushed voice box. High-energy injury? We don't think so.
It's hard to believe. Do they think we're idiots or something?
Cops imprison you, shoot you, sever your spine, crush your larynx, send you
to war, keep you poor, call you a thug and get away with it. There's no excuse
for what happened to Freddie.
