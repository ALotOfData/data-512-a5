Ad Text Native American teens made an interesting journey through their ancestral
lands. The journey was led by Sarah Pemberton member of the Delaware
Nation. Sarah and her partner Kyle Harris created a movie about the journey
called "The Water Gap: Return to the Homelands" which already won the
award at the Native American Film Festival of the Southeast.
Propaganda of native culture and traditions is one of most powerful weapons
in Native American fight for their rights. People have always tried to destroy
things they don't understand. And white people never understood native
culture properly. Many teens who had native ancestors deep in the past know
nothing about their culture. Films, journeys, even videos on Youtube, can
help.
