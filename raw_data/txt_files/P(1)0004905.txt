Ad Text Shelden Gibbs is only 11-year-old but he's already started a fashion
accessory line! Gibbs produces at least 5 original ties each day! His mom
helps him. They called their company Classic Knot. Their customers are so
happy to wear these ties that Classic Knot is going to hire some extra
employees!
By the way this business is not an obstacle for school. Shelden's classmates
even offer their help too!
"I teach him the sky is the limit from here. Dream big, think big, don't think
small or you'll always have small," said Shelden's mother Rhonda Woods and
she's absolutely right! It's so good that kids are thinking of pleasing other
people and supporting their families!
