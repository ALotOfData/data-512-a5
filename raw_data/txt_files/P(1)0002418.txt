Ad Text Ex-Ferguson Cop Darren Wilson: Incident'Makes Me Unemployable'
Do you know the best way to ruin your career in the US? Follow the rules and
the "miracle" won't be late in arriving.
I bet you remember the white former officer who shot and killed an unarmed
black teen in Ferguson, last August? After national debate over the
relationship between police and black communities Darren Wilson aka "Bad
cop, who killed innocent black child" tried to go back to police work but was
turned down because he's too big a liability.
In the recent interview to New Yorker magazine he said, "It's too hot an issue,
so it makes me unemployable."
So what does the situation mean to America?
Almost nothing except one thing... a man's life may be ruined because he had
the audacity to defend himself against huge man with malicious intent.
Michael Brown was a thug, who had just assaulted a store owner, and robbed
him. Do you have any idea what should police officer do in such situation? He
must stop the criminal, period. He was in a no-win situation and it proves how
upside-down society has become.
I wonder, what will be the next step of American justice degradation? Will
surgeons be fired for operate patients with knives? Will Supreme Court send
teachers to jail for teaching?
Instead hate Wilson, we should pray for him. He did nothing wrong but idiots
turned society against an innocent man. So is it a new America?
