Ad Text Expecting mother includes late husband in maternity photo shoot
Through the struggles and pains of losing a dear husband. Nicole Bennett has
built courage to take maternity photos with her 4-year-old son. She added old
photos of late husband Deonta, but they were slightly faded to appear as a
spirit â€” a symbol of hope that he watches over them.
She also did this as a memorial for her unborn daughter who is due March 25.
We commend her for her boldness and we hope that she finds solace in these
photos.
