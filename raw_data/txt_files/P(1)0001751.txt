American lives and hundreds of billions of dollars. The goal was to "disrupt
the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations." Well, the
intervention deprived al-Qaida of a sanctuary. But al-Qaida — even after its
leader Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. commandos — has spawned cells
elsewhere and inspired other extremists in Syria and Iraq. And now ISIS is
rising as the most powerful terrorist organisation in the world. So, the question
is whether it's worth to risk the lives of thousands of American soldiers for the
mission that hardly can be called successful? It seems that Obama should
review his military strategy without delay.Join us! Veterans USA( @veterans
