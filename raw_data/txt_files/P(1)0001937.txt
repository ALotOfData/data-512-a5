Oakland police officers fatally shot a man suspected in alleged carjacking
attempt in Downtown Oakland Wednesday night. Is it a race war?
Yesterday night. a group of 50 protesters burned Confederate flag and tried to
shutdown a freeway in Downtown Oakland. The opposition to police violence
was in response to the police shooting earlier in the day.
According to Oakland Police Department, yesterday at 2:39 p.m. in the area
of 69th Avenue and International Boulevard. Oakland police officers spotted a
vehicle they believe to be connected to a previous robbery on July 27. The
pursuit started when the driver fled through Oakland streets until the suspect
crashed into another car in the area of 27th Avenue and Martin Luther King
Jr. street. But when the suspect ran of the car, three officers opened fire. The
suspect Joe Bart has died at the hospital.
Did you know that it was fifth shooting this year that involved police officers?
How quickly it has become so usual? Why it has become so legit? Where is
the government speaking about the existence of racism in America?
