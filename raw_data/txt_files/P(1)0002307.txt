Ad Text Today is a good day to honor our Navy forces. 72 years ago our ships took
part in operation "overlord", landing our forces in Europe. We can't say we
have brilliant commandership now, but our soldiers are as brave as our
grandfathers were.
Our sailors not only fight our enemies in the seas and oceans, they also
challenge the water elemental itself, sailing for months without seeing the
shores of their home. God bless the U.S. Navy!
