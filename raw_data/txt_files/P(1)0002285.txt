On August 11, 1972 the last US ground combat unit left South Vietnam. Direct
U.S. military involvement ended on 15 August 1973. The government spent
more than $120 billion on the conflict in Vietnam from 1965-73 that led to the
widespread inflation. Psychological effects were even deeper. The war had
pierced the myth of American invincibility, and had bitterly divided the nation.
Many returning veterans faced negative reactions from both opponents of the
war and its supporters.
In 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was created in Washington, D.C.
There the names of 57,939 American armed forces killed or missing during
the war are inscribes. Latter the total additions brought to 58,267.
