Ad Text 14 Police Officers Take Down A One-legged Homeless Black Man Armed
With Crutches in San Francisco
Writer Chaedria LaBouvier reported that she had seen 14 San Francisco
police officers subduing a homeless black man who had one leg outside
Twitter headquarters.
Witnesses told LaBouvier that police had been called because the man was
waving sticks," which later turned out to be his crutches.
None of the employees at Twitter or other tech companies came out to object
as the 14 officers took down the one-legged homeless man.
The U.S. Justice Department recently filed court documents in an Idaho case
which declared it unconstitutional to criminalize homelessness. According to
the Coalition on Homelessness, the city handed out 11,000 citations to
homeless people who were sitting on sidewalks between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m.
in 2014.
What kind of people police usually hire? Mentally unstable bloodthirsty
cowards or? We already know the answer. Sometimes we all wonder do
police officers have mercy for anyone? Hard to say, because what we see
confuses us.
