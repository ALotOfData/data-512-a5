Ad Text Saudi prince urged Americans not to vote for Trump last week. How
wonderful, an Islamic dictator advises Americans how to run a Republic!
Saudi Arabia is considered the main weapon and recruit provider to Islamic
State terrorist organization.
No wonder radical Islamists are terrified by Trump, unlike Obama he is a
strong confident man who'll deal with terrorism with no doubt. When
terrorists' "official" leaders call to reject a Presidential candidate - you've got
the man you need.
