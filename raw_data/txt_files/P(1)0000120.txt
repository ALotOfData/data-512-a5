banquet for his co-workers Wednesday, killing 14 people and seriously
wounding more than a dozen others in a precision assault. Hours later, two
terrorists died in a shootout with San Bernardino police. One shooter still at
large.
It is known that gunmen are Muslims. They are very religious and probably
linked with ISIS. California shooting should become a lesson for the
administration â€” accepting refugees from Syria threatens the National
security.
It's tragedy. Enemies of America attacked our people again. Unfortunately,
today we have no strong leader who is courageous enough to conquer
terrorism. Nevertheless, we will not allow terrorists to change our way of life.
We will not allow them to restrict our freedoms.
We express our sincere condolences to families of victims in California
shooting. If you want to express sympathy for victims, change your Facebook
