Ad Text We have more in common than you may think. American politicians came to
our country, made fortune destroying it, leaving families, lives and cities
destroyed. This is how they do it when they need money. Syria grief is our
grief too because we know what it's like to be in their place. Let's pray for
people in Syria! Amen.
