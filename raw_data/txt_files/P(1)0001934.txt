Ad Text Alabama Police Officer Kept His Job After Proposal to Murder Black Man and
Hide Evidence
A police officer in Alabama proposed murdering a black resident and creating
bogus evidence to suggest the killing was in self-defense.
Officer Troy Middlebrooks kept his job and continues to patrol Alexander City
after authorities there paid the man $35,000 to avoid being publicly sued over
the incident. Middlebrooks, a veteran of the US marines, said the man "needs
a god damn bullet" and allegedly referred to him as "that nigger", after
becoming frustrated that the man was not punished more harshly over a prior
run-in.
The payment was made to the black resident, Vincent Bias, after a secret
recording of Middlebrooks's remarks was played to the city's police chiefs
and the mayor. Elected city councillors said they were not consulted.
Do you know that you can go to prison for murderous intent? However, if you
are a white police officer, offering to KILL a BLACK AMERICAN and then hide
the evidence, then you don't even get fired. Oh yeah, it's happening in a
wonderful state called Alabama! You know how it works here. Do you have
any more questions for American law enforcement system?
