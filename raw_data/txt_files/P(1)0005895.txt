Ad Text Prior to cooking delicious five-star cuisine, celebrity chef Jeff Henderson
cooked something else entirely dangerousâ€”cocaine. As a teenager,
Henderson manufactured and sold drugs in his native home in Los Angeles.
By 19, he was already earning US $35,000 per week. Henderson was later
apprehended and imprisoned for 10 years after one of his men was caught
carrying a big shipment. It was in prison that he discovered his natural flair for
cooking, while he was on kitchen duty.
He was released early for good behavior and soon started working for some
of LA's top restaurants before venturing into Las Vegas. After experiencing
many rejections due to his felonious past, Henderson finally managed to land
a job at Caesar's Palace. It was only a matter of time before he finally started
getting recognition and awards, including best Las Vegas Chef in 2001. All
the fame and success hasn't gotten to Henderson's head though and he has
continued to share his experiences with at-risk youth to show what they can
achieve in life with the right choices.
