Ad Text Congressional Republicans voted on Thursday to make it more difficult for
refugees from Syria and Iraq to come to the US as the fallout from last
Friday's Isis terrorist attacks in Paris continues.
In addition, more than half of the US's governors have said they will no
longer provide placement for Syrian refugees, arguing that they pose too
great a risk to national security.
New Jersey governor and Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie
has said his state will not take in any refugees â€” "not even orphans under the
age of five".
Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal has said he has directed state police to
"track" the Syrian refugees in his state, something his state police have
played down.
GOP presidential hopefuls Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush have suggested the US
government prioritize Christian refugees.
Barack Obama has pledged to veto the legislation, and has condemned the
anti-refugee comments as "un-American", but experts worry the backlash
could have dangerous consequences if these claims go unchecked.

"Sowing fear of refugees is exactly the kind of response groups like Isis are
seeking," said lain Levine, deputy executive director for program at Human
Rights Watch, on Thursday. "Yes, governments need to bring order to
refugee processing and weed out militant extremists, but now more than ever
they also need to stand with people uprooted from their homes by ideologies
of hatred and help them find real protection."
