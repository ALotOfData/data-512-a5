Ad Text In 1986, Jerome Smith was sentenced to life in prison for a crime he didn't
commit.
The prosecutor hid key evidence that goes to the heart of Jerome's
innocence until 2001, 15 years after the trial.
No jury ever saw or heard that evidence. Jerome's attorneys were unable to
prepare properly which hindered their defense.
