Ad Text "People can tolerate two homosexuals they see leaving together, but the next
day they're smiling, holding hands, tenderly embracing one another, then they
cannot be forgiven. It is not the departure for pleasure that is unacceptable, it
is waking up happy."
-Michel Foucault, philosopher and social critic.
