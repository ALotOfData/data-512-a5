Ad Text Transgender employees will get health coverage
On Tuesday the federal government ordered health insurers to include
transition-related health coverage for transgender employees in their plans.
"Effective January 1, 2016, no carrier participating in the Federal Employees
Health Benefits Program may have a general exclusion of services, drugs or
supplies related to gender transition or `sex transformations,"' the new
"carrier letter" said.
LGBT advocates who have been pressing the administration for change
welcomed the news. "With today's announcement, transgender federal
employees can now access health care that is so fundamental to their wellbeing and, in the long-term, will make transgender employees happier and
more productive workers," National Center for Transgender Equality
Executive Director Mara Keisling told.
Yeah, it is really happy news for transgender people! Now the discrimination
on coverage for trans people will be ended.
