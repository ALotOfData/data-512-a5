Ad Text Governor of the State of Mississippi has proclaimed the month of April 2016
as Confederate Heritage Month. We don't want to honor racism, slavery and
hatred. Yet this is what Confederate Heritage is. The Confederate flag is
Americas most potent symbol of white supremacy. Symbols of hate have no
place in our government.
Join our "Not My Heritage" Rally at 2 pm on March 26th, 398 Mississipi st,
Jackson. Mississipi.
