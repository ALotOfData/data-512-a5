Ad Text SHOCKING!!! Cops can't stop using their blue privilege for illegal parking.
Could you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she
realized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face
is priceless.
The story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for
illegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver, who
had towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The
driver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under
threat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125.
The sheriff's office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11
years and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that
how PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix
the situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer
is to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not
have mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon.
To my mind, this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun.
Such cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give
our citizens a chance to get back home alive.
