Ad Text Another Woman Commits Suicide In Jail
A teen committed suicide in a jail cell an hour after being arrested, another
suspicious case of a Black woman dying in police custody in the past week.
The second case over a week, huh? How retarded and/or brainwashed by
Fox News is one supposed to be to believe this is a coincidence? No way we
are gonna buy such bullshit.
The weirdest thing about this specific case is that the suicide was committed
just an hour after the arrest. Moreover, the woman was suspected of stealing
someone's phone which is quite not a reason for getting to her account.
We've got to also take into consideration that 1 in 3 black men go to prison as
opposed to a considerably lower rate with the white men (http://www.alternet.
org/story/154587/1 _in_3_black_men_g(:_to_prison_the_10_most_disturbing_
facts_about racial_inequality_in_the_u.s._criminal_justice_system).
It definitely seems like there's more to this since until recently taking into
custody hasn't been a reason for suicide among black women. Now for some
people the only way to deal with police violence at the police stations is simply
killing themselves...
