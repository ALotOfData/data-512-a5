Ad Text It's just ridiculous that we lack money for veterans' healthcare and housing,
lack recourses to enforce our border security, but at the same time have
enough budget funds to continue this devastating policy of bombing foreign
countries. Ordinary Americans get zero profit from oil wars that last for years
but don't end. Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, we've been involved in conflicts in
these countries for years, and none of these conflicts gave us anything but
growing state debt.
