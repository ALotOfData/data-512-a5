Ad Text Clark Dickson. a veteran Seattle police department officer, punched a
homeless 21-year-old man in the head and remained unpunished. The cop
said that his misconduct was "justified" because the man had spit at him.
Almost one year after the incident. the footage showing the punch was
released. Personally. I didn't notice in the video the suspect spitting at
Dickson. However; the police department didn't consider it necessary to
punish the cop. The only penalty he got was a suspension without pay for 1
day.
Is it really enough for excessive force use?
