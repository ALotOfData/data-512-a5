Ad Text Our hearts are heavy with grief that we have lost another vibrant member of
our community too soon. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of Amber's
family and friends whom she clearly loved deeply.
Trans woman murdered in Detroit. According to initial police reports, 20-yearold Amber Monroe was shot to death.
A lot of transgendered women don't have support systems or employment.
So they are forced to do whatever they can do to survive. This attack was
fueled by transphobia and we do know that Amber's murder is the 12th
murder of a transgender woman in the United States this year, and the 10th
murder of a transgender woman of color. Transgender women, and especially
transgender women of color, are disproportionately affected by violence.
Her life was just beginning... I know that this loss will leave so many people
with a hole in their lives and with more questions than answers. Let's work for
real change so that our transgender sisters can be free from persecution. I
know we can do better. We have to do better!
