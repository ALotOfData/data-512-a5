Ad Text Man rammed St. Louis police car'for the black people'. Black people are fed
up with an age of racist society?
The 48-year-old Kevin Labriado from Bellefontaine Neighbors was charged
for ramming police car from behind twice screaming "for black people". He
assaulted two officers and his child who was sitting in his car. Two St. Louis
officers were on patrol until Labriado and his five-year-old daughter
accidentally rammed their car. When police officer tried to arrest him,
Labriado yelled several times "This is for the black people".
What if Labriado sought to revenge for all black lives that officers took away?
Racism obviously gave rise to the tensions in society that led to disrespect
and hate. Moreover, black people are fed up with racism and police violence
towards black community. What is more, racial tensions have gotten worse
under the current government. Even after several months of protests over the
deaths of Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Michael Brown, Sandra Bland and Freddie
Gray the government inspired more unrest. Today black community is in
desperate situation seeking for help.
