Ad Text What's the difference between USA cops and EU cops?
That's a fact that US police officers are bad trained. Cops are programmed to
take innocent lives. Cops here in America play God. They believe they are
judge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law,
it is their job to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot
someone who is not a threat simply because that person "deserves it" in their
eyes.
It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the
difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will
get away with it.
In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand
that their job is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,
they understand that they are not the jury and this is not their job.
Bad that America trained not like this!???
