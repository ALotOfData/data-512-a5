Throughout the twenty-first century there are thousands of complaints of the
police "profiling" black drivers in America. Black Americans often complaint
about being pulled over for the phenomenon called "driving while black". For
example, a rich African American driving new Ferrari can be stopped
hundreds of times for no apparent reason just because the fact that a black
man driving an expensive car attract the attention of the police officers.
But what if racial profiling ends with lethal consequences? Do you remember
Sandra Bland who had run-ins with the police while driving? Do you all
remember that she was found dead in police custody? Do we all have to
avoid traffic stops in order to survive?
For the matter of fact, the routine traffic stops are being a big deal for the
people of color. According to the Justice Department statistics, black drivers
are about 31 percent more likely to be subject to police than whites. Overall,
this number indicates the racial difference in America.
