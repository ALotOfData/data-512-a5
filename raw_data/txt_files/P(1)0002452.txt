Ad Text Colorado court sides against baker who refused same-sex marriage cake
order
The appellate court ruled that requiring the cake shop to comply with an antidiscrimination law does not violate the First Amendment.
The ruling was premised chiefly on the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act,
which prohibits discrimination on the basis of a number of protected
categories, including sexual orientation.
I'm so sick of this true Christians who have never taken the Bible in their
hands. reading or listening someone who read ancient texts and then
declaring them to be applicable to today violates the scriptures. God didn't
support divorces, so why did bakers not refuse service to divorcees?
Anyway, the truth on our side... finally. So, grab your bae and go to eat some
cakes!
