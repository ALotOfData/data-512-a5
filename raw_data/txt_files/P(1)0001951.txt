Ad Text Power-Drunk Pig Threatens To "Drag" Teens Out Of Car
Police officer Jeff Willis is facing disciplinary action after a video surfaced of
him violently threatening teenagers because they were smiling at him and not
taking him seriously enough. Willis pulled them over because one of the
passengers allegedly flipped him the middle fighter from the window.
When one of the young men asks the officer "What did I do?" the officer
responds by saying, "I don't know. I just don't like you, I just don't like you."
The only crime committed by the occupants of the car was shooting the video.
We have a legal right to film and photograph police, in every state! People
should know their rights - it's the first step to stop police brutality.
If another person smiling makes you that upset, you should not be permitted
to own a gun. People, who have mental illness or anger issues should not
having access to guns. Guns should be in the hands of responsible adults!
Police went out of the control. How much respect do you think Police has for
people? 0! In this way, if you can't control yourself it's time to retire, you don't
deserve to carry the badge.
America needs better gun control. Although, it's not the type of gun that is the
problem. It is the type of gun owner that is the problem. America, control your
blue pigs!
