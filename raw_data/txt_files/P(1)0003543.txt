Ad Text Dear Don't Shooters, as you know we aim to empower and encourage people
to take action in struggle for social justice. "Unite and fight against police
brutality!" - that's our moto.
From time to time we receive messages like "why you do not talk about good
cops?" Well, I guess it's time to answer the question...
As the nation has been torn apart by police violence and abuse, we have
begun to wonder whether there are any good cops at all. Do they exist?
Where are these legendary "good cops"? Sad, but according to our research
good cops are threatened with extinction.
After sleepless nights with coffee and YouTube search we finally found a
great example of a GOOD COP. Please welcome - Mr. Right Officer, who
comes to the suspect's aid, not once, not twice, but at least three times
physically stopping the arresting officer from abusing the suspect.
If you think that all cops SHOULD take a stand like this, then help us
SPREAD THE WORD!
