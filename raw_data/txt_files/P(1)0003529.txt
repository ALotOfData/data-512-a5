Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of
his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the
ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the
location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on
the passenger's side.
When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the
situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man
briefly lying unconscious on the ground.
The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows
that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?
Damn, after all that, the only thing I may conclude is DO NOT TALK TO
POLICE! The following video is a prime example of why...
