Ad Text FEMALE SOCCER PLAYERS GET MARRIED, HAVE PERFECT MESSAGE
FOR HATERS!
Meet professional soccer players Erin McLeod and Ella Masar, who play for
Houston Dash in the National Women's Soccer League. The long-time
partners married this week; just days after the end of the Women's World
Cup.
Along with sincere congratulations, the couple also received plenty of
negative messages; from people who didn't think two women should get
married.
Masar had this perfect message for those people. In spite of all their hatred
her message is full of love because love wins despite any obstacles:
"Thank you for praying for me and reinforcing my own prayers because as
you pray, "Lord please help Ella, allow her to see her sin for loving that
woman, for respecting her, being faithful, honoring her, etc ..." Know I am
saying the same thing; "my Heavenly Father, thank you for allowing me find
my better half; for finding someone that strengthens my faith and allows me to
be the person I always imagined. Thank you for teaching me what truly loving
someone and others is all about. amen."
Congratulations, you two! We hope you both have a full and wonderful life
together!
