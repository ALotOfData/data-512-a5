Ad Text Please share this disturbing video. A routine revenue collection stop turned
into a nightmare for this black man.
Kevin Campbell was driving his wife's minivan home in June when he was
targeted for revenue collection by Allen Park Police Officer Daniel Mack.
Mack literally kidnapped Campbell, placed him in handcuffs, threw him in a
cage over a suspended license, accused Campbell of having drugs on him
despite the fact that the K9 didn't find anything. Moreover, the cop sodomized
him by putting the illegal substance inside his body. There was no search
warrant.
