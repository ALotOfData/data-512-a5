Ad Text Good morning, dear patriots!
Love your country. Your country is the land where your parents sleep, where
is spoken that language in which the chosen of your heart, blushing,
whispered the first word of love; it is the home that God has given you that by
striving to perfect yourselves therein you may prepare to ascend to him.
