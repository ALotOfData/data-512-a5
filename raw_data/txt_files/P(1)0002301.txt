Ad Text Every American's right to bear arms is absolutely sacred, period. All the
liberal attacks on it are very worrying because the Amendment was not only
made for self defense — it is a nation's ability to overthrow the tyranny. A
Government that doesn't trust its citizens to possess weapons can never
receive mutual trust or respect. And that's what things are now — there's a
great mistrust between the people and the country Administration and the
only way for our "leaders" to establish relations with Americans is to stop all
attacks on the Second Amendment.
