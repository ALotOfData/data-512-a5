Ad Text Robert Bentley, Alabama Governor, has decided to reform prison system.
This is actually good news? Alabama happens to be one of the nation's
poorest states which have led to overcrowd in its prison. The prison system
houses 24,000 inmates but it was designed for 13,000.Let me enlighten you a
little on how it's going to be done. Four other larger prisons will be built
additionally to prevent the rate of overcrowd. Even though one would have
taught of using this money for projects like health care facilities and other, he
chose prisons. It's not bad though, at least inmates will have free live behind
bars. It shows how much he cares for his people.
