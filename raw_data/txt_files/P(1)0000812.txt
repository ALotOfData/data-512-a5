Ad Text The US-led coalition strike in Syria's Raqqa province killed 12 women, the
Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said this morning. The second coalition
strike on a town near the Iraqi border killed 23 more civilians. Just to make it
clear: our government is proposing spending cuts to most government
agencies to pay for large increases in military, and everything we got from this
is more and more civilians deaths. EPA, State and other development
programs, Agriculture, Labor, Justice, Health and Human Services,
Education, and many other domestic agencies faced more than 20% cuts in
their budgets, and only the Department of Defense has grown by 10%.
However, terrorists weren't destroyed in '30 days' and it seems like they
won't be destroyed in the closest perspective. I mentioned before, and I will
do it again: this is not a war against terrorism or a war 'for freedom', it's
another example of money conflict, filling politician's pockets with blood
money is the main goal of it. For America, another continuous military conflict
can lead to a financial crisis, this is exactly what happened in 2008.
