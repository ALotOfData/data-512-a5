Ad Text Three Bronx officers were caught on camera by the passenger in a car as the
driver appears to be repeatedly punched in the head and thrown to the
ground.
"Y'all is punching me in the face. What did I do to deserve this? the
24-year-old Timothy Nelson can be heard saying in the recording of the July
26 traffic stop.
Do they really need 20 cops showing up for a traffic stop? And that's why I'd
rather call a crack head for help before I call the cops they don't protect and
serve, they shoot and kill anybody that's not wearing a police badge. And I do
not wear it.
