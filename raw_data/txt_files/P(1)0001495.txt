Ad Text It is so disheartening knowing that people are put behind bars because they
failed to settle a fine. Most people are jailed because one way or the other
there was no money to do what was necessary at a particular time even
though they were innocent. Prosecutors have developed this platform as a
gold mine, extracting huge sum of money from civilians. You can be put
behind bars if you fail to comply with the demands. Suddenly one's life
becomes tattered when jail comes in, because there is no freedom of making
a better living. Federal prosecutors should shake up and hold judges and all
these people who take advantages of people by making them pay huge sums
of money or put someone behind bars because he/she couldn't pay a fine.
