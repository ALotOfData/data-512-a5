Ad Text Overheard two people(white old ladies) talking about a particular film they
watched recently. Their comments about Black female actress almost made
me choke on my saliva.
Believe me, I had to step-in, cus these ugly madafakas were describing our
Queens as if it was the fault of Black female actors to be dope and on-point
af.
I ended with, "if it disgusts you, dont f****** watch movies with Black actors,
bs"... dropped the mic. and was on my way!
