Ad Text RUBY ROSE SHARING THOUGHTS ABOUT GENDER FLUIDITY.
Ruby Rose has long been the celebrity crush of lesbians the world over. But
now that she's a star in 'Orange is the New Black', the popularity of this
model, actress, and VJ has grown worldwide.
"Gender fluidity is not really feeling like you're at one end of the spectrum or
the other. For the most part, I definitely don't identify as any gender," - Rose
said; - "I'm not a guy; I don't really feel like a woman, but obviously I was born
one. As a little kid, I was convinced that I was a guy. Then in my teens, I tried
to be quite feminine...And after a little bit, chopped everything off and am kind
of back where I started. So, I'm somewhere in the middle, which - in my
perfect imagination - is like having the best of both sexes."
