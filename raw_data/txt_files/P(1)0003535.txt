Ad Text Cops are allergic to cameras, they don't like being recorded because it won't
allow them to break the law and lie about the circumstances which presented
them the opportunity to break the law.
?WARNING!!!? In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in
a public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense
altercation with a student.
According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim,
Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom.
The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a
brief clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him.
I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more
then a bunch of bullies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever
happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an
officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide
something and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also, is not
destruction of evidence a crime?
What do you think about it guys? Please, share or comment below.
