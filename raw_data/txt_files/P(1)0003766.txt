Ad Text PLEASE HELP VICTIM OF ANTI-MUSLIM HATE CRIME
Mohamed Rasheed Khan, 59 became victim of a vicious hate crime. He was
brutally attacked by three men outside a mosque in Queens.
Mr. Khan suffered a concussion, as well as fractures to his face and ribs.
Please help Mr. Khan's family to raise enough money for all medical surgery
and hospital expenses.
If you are unable to help financially, we understand. Please share this
fundraising post with others so more people become aware: I believe together we can do this:
In this month of Ramadan we kindly ask everyone to keep Mohamed
Rasheed Khan in your prayers for his well being and a speedy recovery! Lets
help our fellow brother reunite with his family. InsAllahl.
