Ad Text Cleveland judge won't be forced to issue warrants in Rice shooting
A divided Ohio appeals court panel on Friday said it would not force a
municipal judge to issue arrest warrants for Cleveland police officers involved
in the fatal shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in a city park last November.
Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Ronald Adrine in June found probable
cause for Officer Timothy Loehmann, who shot Rice, and his partner, Frank
Garmback, to face charges in the shooting.
Loehmann shot Rice twice within seconds of arriving outside a city recreation
center on Nov. 22 in response to an emergency call of a man with a gun.
Rice, who was playing with an Airsoft-type replica handgun that shoots
pellets, died the next day.
By any means the justice system is trying to justify the cops, who should've
been never employed even. They shot the poor kid in 2 seconds after they
arrived, not even having time to understand the situation. Everyday police use
excessive force and weapons against unarmed people. Killers in uniform...
Let's honor Tamir's memory one more time.
