Ad Text Straight Outta Compton is straight reality
The new movie Straight Outta Compton focus on legendary hip-hop pioneers
N.W.A. and their struggles against racism and police violence. The movie is
coming this weekend in the theaters. However, some of the cinemas refused
to show the movie, citing "safety and liability" concerns.
Does it remind you of anything? How about Ferguson? How about Baltimore?
Today you are willing to be detained in the name of defending your rights.
Today cops can easily shoot you for a small violation. Even having black cops
and black mayors doesn't end police brutality. Fortunately today you are
allowed to record police officers in order to further prevent potentially serious
cases of police wrongdoing fairly.
