Ad Text I see many young Black girls skating and excelling in a field that used to be
predominantly white. In the sense that efforts were really made to prevent
Black people from participating in such sports, back in the days.
But thanks to Debi Thomas and other Black skaters; we changed the game
and on Feb. 8. 1986. Debi became the first Black skater to hold a US national
titles in ladies' single figure scating.
Debi; a physician, became the 1986 World champion, the 1988 Olympic
bronze medalist; and a two-time U.S. national champion.
