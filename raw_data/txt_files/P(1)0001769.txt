Ad Text Why our government wastes $11 MLN per day on ISIL Instead of saving more
than 1300 lives of vets. Why do we engage in another conflict when we have
so many unsolved problems in the U.S?
It is a shame that our vets are treated so badly. They do not receive proper
health care and unemployment benefits. They do not receive the respect they
deserve. I do not want our government to create new veterans in such
conditions.
